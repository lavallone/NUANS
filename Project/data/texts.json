for, when he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the ingle, poking about in the cinders.", "Well, one day a skipper came and asked Halvor if he hadn't a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands.", "Yes, Halvor would like that very much; so he wasn't long in getting himself ready.", "How long they sailed I'm sure I can't tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn't tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about.", "Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed lying wind-bound there, and Halvor asked the skipper's leave to go on shore and look about him; he would sooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep.", "\"Do you think now you're fit to show yourself before folk,\" said the skipper, \"why, you've no clothes than those rags you stand in?\"", "But Halvor stuck to his own, and so at last he got leave", "but he was to be sure and come back as soon as ever it began to blow.", "So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat corn-fields and rich meads, but he couldn't catch a glimpse of a living soul.", "Well, it began to blow, but Halvor thought he hadn't seen enough yet, and he wanted to walk a little farther, just to see if he couldn't meet any folk.", "So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it.", "Halvor followed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone.", "So as he had now walked the whole day and hadn't taken a bit to eat with him; he was as hungry as a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the more afraid he got.", "In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, and Halvor went into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days.", "It was so grand and fine; there were vessels of silver and vessels of gold, but still never a living soul.", "So when Halvor had stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat a Princess who span upon a spinning-wheel.", "\"Nay, nay, now!\"", "she called out, \"dare Christian folk come hither?", "But now you'd best be off about your business, if you don't want the Troll to gobble you up; for here lives a Troll with three heads.\"", "\"All one to me,\" said the lad, \"I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is.", "As for going, I won't go at all.", "I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death.\"", "When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that; hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up.", "\"Oh!\" said the Princess, \"now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword.\"", "So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo!", "just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing.", "Halvor jumped behind the door.", "\",\" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door,\" what a smell of Christian man's blood!\"", "\"Ay,\" said Halvor, \"you'll soon know that to your cost,\" and with that he hewed off all his heads.", "Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said,\u2014 \"Would my sisters were free too!\"", "\"Where are they?\" asked Halvor.", "Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his castle, which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his castle, which was fifty miles farther still.", "\"But now,\" she said, \"you must first help me to get this ugly carcase out of the house.\"", "Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time.", "So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of gray dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day.", "When he first saw the castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen.", "So Halvor went into the kitchen, and did'nt stop there either, but went straight farther on into the house.", "\"Nay, nay,\" called out the Princess, \"dare Christian folk come hither?", "I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man.", "'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads.\"", "\"I shan't go,\" said Halvor, \"if he had six heads besides.\"", "\"He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,\" said the Princess.", "But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey.", "Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again.", "\"No,\" said Halvor, \"I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about.\"", "\"He won't stay to ask that,\" said the Princess, \"for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war.\"", "He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it.", "Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door.", "When the Troll got his first head in he called out,\u2014 \", what a smell of Christian man's blood!\"", "But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in.", "The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free.", "Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once, but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcase out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning.", "It was a long way to the castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others.", "This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the castle.", "There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there wag no end to her loveliness.", "She, too, like the others, told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads.", "\"Ay, ay,\" said Halvor, \"if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,\" and so he stood fast before the stove.", "The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said,\u2014 \"Let him come as soon as he likes.\"", "So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it.", "Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.", "He was far stouter and bigger than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door.", "So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said,\u2014 \", what a smell of Christian man's blood!\"", "That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it.", "So all the Princesses came together to that castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three.", "But there, after a while, Halvor went about, and was so strange and dull and silent.", "Then the Princesses asked him what he lacked, and if he didn't like to live with them any longer?", "Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see.", "Well, they thought that might be done easily enough.", "\"You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and unscathed, if you will only follow our advice,\" said the Princesses.", "Yes, he'd be sure to mind all they said.", "So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king's son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure not to take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he'd never see them more.", "\"If I only stood at home I'd be glad,\" said Halvor; and it was done as he had wished.", "Then stood Halvor at his father's cottage door before he knew a word about it.", "Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got so afraid they began to bow and scrape.", "Then Halvor asked if he couldn't stay there, and have a lodging there that night.", "No; that he couldn't.", "\"We can't do it at all,\" they said, \"for we haven't this thing or that thing which such a lord is used to have; 'twere best your lordship went up to the farm, no long way off, for you can see the chimneys, and there they have lots of everything.\"", "Halvor wouldn't hear of it\u2014he wanted to stop; but the old couple stuck to their own, that he had better go to the farmer's; there he would get both meat and drink; as for them, they hadn't even a chair to offer him to sit down on.", "\"No,\" said Halvor, \"I won't go up there till to-morrow early, but let me just stay here to-night; worst come to the worst, I can sit in the chimney corner.\"", "Well, they couldn't say anything against that; so Halvor sat down by the ingle, and began to poke about in the ashes, just as he used to do when he lay at home in old days, and stretched his lazy bones.", "Well, they chattered and talked about many things; and they told Halvor about this thing and that; and so he asked them if they had never had any children.", "\"Yes, yes, they had once a lad whose name was Halvor, but they didn't know whither he had wandered; they couldn't even tell whether he were dead or alive.\"", "\"Couldn't it be me now?\" said Halvor.", "\"Let me see; I could tell him well enough,\" said the old wife, and rose up.", "\"Our Halvor was so lazy and dull, he never did a thing; and besides, he was so ragged, that one tatter took hold of the next tatter on him.", "No; there never was the making of such a fine fellow in him as you are, master.\"", "A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on Halvor's face, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once.", "\"Ah! but is it you after all, Halvor?\" she cried; and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared, and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing would do but he must go up at once to the farmer's and show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down on him.", "And off she went first, and Halvor followed after.", "So, when she got up there, she told them all how her Halvor had come home again, and now they should only just see how grand he was, for, said she, \"he looks like nothing but a king's son.\"", "\"All very fine,\" said the lassies, and tossed up their heads.", "\"We'll be bound he's just the same beggarly, ragged boy he always was.\"", "Just then in walked Halvor, and then the lassies were all so taken aback, they forgot their sarks in the ingle, where they were sitting darning their clothes, and ran out in their smocks.", "Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at Halvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty.", "\"Ay, ay,\" said Halvor, \"you always thought   so pretty and neat, no one could come near you; but now you should just see the eldest Princess I have set free; against her you look just like milkmaids, and the midmost is prettier still; but the youngest, who is my sweetheart, she's fairer than both sun and moon.", "Would to Heaven she were only here,\" said Halvor, \"then you'd see what you would see.\"", "He had scarce uttered these words before there they stood, but then he felt so sorry, for now what they had said came into his mind.", "Up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the Princesses, and much was made of them, but they wouldn't stop there.", "\"No; we want to go down to your father and mother,\" they said to Halvor; \"", "and so we'll go out now and look about us.\"", "So he went down with them, and they came to a great lake just outside the farm.", "Close by the water was such a lovely green bank; here the Princesses said they would sit and rest a while; they thought it so sweet to sit down and look over the water.", "So they sat down there, and when they had sat a while, the youngest Princess said,\u2014 \"I may as well comb your hair a little, Halvor.\"", "Yes, Halvor laid his head on her lap, and so she combed his bonny locks, and it wasn't long before Halvor fell fast asleep.", "Then she took the ring from his finger, and put another in its stead; and so she said,\u2014 \"Now hold me all together!", "and now would we were all in Soria Moria Castle.\"", "So when Halvor woke up, he could very well tell that he had lost the Princesses, and began to weep and wail; and he was so downcast, they couldn't comfort him at all.", "In spite of all his father and mother said, he wouldn't stop there, but took farewell of them, and said he was safe not to see them again; for if he couldn't find the Princesses again, he thought it not worth while to live.", "Well, he had still three hundred dollars left, so he put them into his pocket, and set out on his way.", "So when he had walked a while, he met a man with a tidy horse, and he wanted to buy it, and began to chaffer with the man.", "\"Ay,\" said the man, \"to tell the truth, I never thought of selling him; but if we could strike a bargain, perhaps\"\u2014 \"What do you want for him,\" asked Halvor.", "\"I didn't give much for him, nor is he worth much; he's a brave horse to ride, but he can't draw at all; still he's strong enough to carry your knapsack and you too, turn and turn about,\" said the man.", "At last they agreed on the price, and Halvor laid the knapsack on him, and so he walked a bit, and rode a bit, turn and turn about.", "At night he came to a green plain where stood a great tree, at the roots of which he sat down.", "There he let the horse loose, but he didn't lie down to sleep, but opened his knapsack and took a meal.", "At peep of day off he set again, for he could take no rest.", "So he rode and walked, and walked and rode the whole day through the wide wood, where there were so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and lovely between the trees.", "He didn't know at all where he was or whither he was going, but he gave himself no more time to rest than when his horse cropped a bit of grass, and he took a snack out of his knapsack when they came to one of those green glades.", "So he went on walking and riding by turns, and as for the wood there seemed to be no end to it.", "But at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming away through the trees.", "\"Would there were folk hereaway,\" thought Halvor, \"that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep body and soul together.\"", "When he got up to it, he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old couple inside.", "They were as grey-headed as a pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose!", "why, it was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she sat in the ingle.", "\"Good evening,\" said Halvor.", "\"Good evening,\" said the old wife.", "\"But what errand can you have in coming hither?\"", "she went on, \"for no Christian folk have been here these hundred years and more.\"", "Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to , and asked if she knew the way thither.", "\"No,\" said the old wife, \"that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything.\"", "So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the treetops, the old wife went out.", "\"Thou Moon, Thou Moon,\" she screamed, \"canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?\"", "\"No,\" said the Moon, \"that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me.\"", "\"Wait a bit still,\" said the old wife to Halvor, \"by and by comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner.\"", "\"Nay, nay,\" said the old wife when she went out again, \"you don't mean to say you've got a horse too; just turn the poor beastie loose in our 'toun,' and don't let him stand there and starve to death at the door.\"", "Then she ran on,\u2014 \"But won't you swop him away to me; we've got an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse, and so you'll get all the sooner to .\"", "That Halvor was willing to do at once; and the old wife was so glad at the horse, she was ready to dance and skip for joy.", "\"For now,\" she said, \"I shall be able to ride to church.", "I too, think of that.\"", "As for Halvor, he had no rest, and wanted to be off at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry.", "\"Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit, for we've no bed to offer you, and I'll watch and wake you when the West Wind comes.\"", "So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again.", "Out ran the old wife.", "\"Thou West Wind, Thou West Wind! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?

that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me.\"", "Out ran Halvor.", "\"You'll have to stretch your legs if you mean to keep up,\" said the West Wind.", "So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell, and Halvor had hard work to keep up.", "\"Well,\" said the West Wind, \"now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle.\"", "In a little while Halvor came upon the lassies who stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of the West Wind, who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding.", "\"Ay, ay, that I have,\" said Halvor, \"he's only gone to tear down a strip of spruce wood.", "It'll not be long before he's here,\" and then he asked them the way to .", "So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them.", "But Halvor was so ragged and torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn't show himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be.", "So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor.", "He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass.", "Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.", "\"Who is most worthy to have one of us,\" she said, \"he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom.\"", "Well they all said there could be but one voice and will as to that, and when Halvor heard that he wasn't long in throwing off his beggar's rags, and arraying himself as bridegroom.", "\"Ay, ay, here is the right one after all,\" said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor.", "Bear and the Fox had once bought a firkin of butter together; they were to have it at Yule, and hid it till then under a thick spruce bush.", "After that they went a little way off and lay down on a sunny bank to sleep.", "So when they had lain a while the Fox got up, shook himself, and bawled out \"yes.\"", "Then he ran off straight to the firkin and ate a good third part of it.", "But when he came back, and the Bear asked him where he had been since he was so fat about

great blundering beetles, and all that mysterious chorus of small sounds that seem always to have been but half heard when they have suddenly ceased, as if conscious of an indiscretion.", "But nothing

natural laws that any seeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning of unthinkable calamity.", "So now the apparently causeless movement of the herbage, and the slow,

his shoulders and fire both barrels at the agitated grass!", "Before the smoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage cry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, flinging his gun upon the ground, Morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot.", "At the same instant I was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something unseen in the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown against me with great force.", "\"Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to have been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in mortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds as one hears from fighting dogs.", "Inexpressibly terrified, I struggled to my feet and looked in the direction of Morgan's retreat; and may heaven in mercy spare me from another sight like that!", "At a distance of less than thirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown back at a frightful angle,

none.", "The other arm was invisible.", "At times, as my memory now reports this extraordinary scene, I could discern but a part of his body; it was as if he had been partly blotted out--I can not otherwise express it--then a shifting of his position would bring it all into view again.", "\"All this must have occurred within a few seconds, yet in that time Morgan assumed all the postures of a determined wrestler vanquished by superior weight and strength.", "I saw nothing but him, and him not always distinctly.", "During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard, as if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I had never heard from the throat of man or brute!", "\"For a moment only I stood irresolute, then, throwing down my gun, I ran forward to my friend's assistance.", "I had a vague belief that he was suffering from a fit or some form of convulsion.", "Before I could reach his side he was down and quiet.", "All sounds had ceased, but, with a feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I now saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of a wood.", "It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to withdraw my eyes and look at my companion.", "He was dead.\"", "The coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man.", "Lifting an edge of the sheet he pulled it away, exposing the entire body, altogether naked and showing in the candle light a clay-like yellow.", "It had, however, broad maculations of bluish-black, obviously caused by extravasated blood from contusions.", "The chest and sides looked as if they had been beaten with a bludgeon.", "There were dreadful lacerations; the skin was torn in strips and shreds.", "The coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk handkerchief, which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the top of the head.", "When the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what had been the throat.", "Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better view repented their curiosity, and turned away their faces.", "Witness Harker went to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and sick.", "Dropping the handkerchief upon the dead man's neck, the coroner stepped to an angle of the room, and from a pile of clothing produced one garment after another, each of which he held up a moment for inspection.", "All were torn, and stiff with blood.", "The jurors did not make a closer inspection.", "They seemed rather uninterested.",

degrees of effort all signed:  \"We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits.\"", "In the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries having, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions.", "At the inquest upon his body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought

night he had burst wildly into Sheehan's, foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hasheesh; and having been supplied in exchange for a promise to perform odd jobs, had hung about ever since, mopping floors, cleaning cuspidors and glasses, and attending to an hundred similar menial duties in exchange for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive and sane.", "He talked but little, and usually in the common jargon of the underworld; but occasionally, when inflamed by an unusually generous dose of crude whiskey, would burst forth into strings of incomprehensible polysyllables and snatches of sonorous prose and verse which led certain habitu\u00e9s to conjecture that he had seen better days.", "One steady patron\u2014a bank defaulter under cover\u2014came to converse with him quite regularly, and from the tone of his discourse ventured the opinion that he had been a writer or professor in his day.", "But the only tangible clue to Old

the deserted pile but a shell-like ruin; yet because it had been the seat of my ancestors, I let no expense deter me.", "The place had not been inhabited since the reign of James the First, when a tragedy of intensely hideous, though largely unexplained, nature had struck down the master, five of his children, and several servants; and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the third son, my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred line.", "With this sole heir denounced as a murderer, the estate had reverted to the crown, nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate himself or regain his property.", "Shaken by some horror greater than that of conscience or the law, and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude the ancient edifice from his sight and memory, Walter de la Poer, eleventh Baron Exham, fled to Virginia and there founded the family which by the next century had become known as Delapore.", "Exham Priory had remained untenanted, though later allotted to the estates of the Norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly composite architecture; an architecture involving Gothic towers resting on a Saxon or Romanesque substructure, whose foundation in turn was of a still earlier order or blend of orders\u2014Roman, and even Druidic or native Cymric, if legends speak truly.", "This foundation was a very singular thing, being merged on one side with the solid limestone of the precipice from whose brink the priory overlooked a desolate valley three miles west of the village of Anchester.", "Architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of forgotten centuries, but the country folk hated it.", "They had hated it hundreds of years before, when my ancestors lived there, and they hated it now, with the moss and mould of abandonment on it.", "I had not been a day in Anchester before I knew I came of an accursed house.", "And this week workmen have blown up Exham Priory, and are busy obliterating the traces of its foundations.", "The bare statistics of my ancestry I had always known, together with the fact that my first American forebear had come to the colonies under a strange cloud.", "Of details, however, I had been kept wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always maintained by the Delapores.", "Unlike our planter neighbours, we seldom boasted of crusading ancestors or other mediaeval and Renaissance heroes; nor was any kind of tradition handed down except what may have been recorded in the sealed envelope left before the Civil War by every squire to his eldest son for posthumous opening.", "The glories we cherished were those achieved since the migration; the glories of a proud and honourable, if somewhat reserved and unsocial Virginia line.", "During the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence changed by the burning of Carfax, our home on the banks of the James.", "My grandfather, advanced in years, had perished in that incendiary outrage, and with him the envelope that had bound us all to the past.", "I can recall that fire today as I saw it then at the age of seven, with the federal soldiers shouting, the women screaming, and the negroes howling and praying.", "My father was in the army, defending Richmond, and after many formalities my mother", "and I were passed through the lines to join him.", "When the war ended we all moved north, whence my mother had come; and I grew to manhood, middle age, and ultimate wealth as a stolid Yankee.", "Neither my father nor I ever knew what our hereditary envelope had contained, and as I merged into the greyness of Massachusetts business life I lost all interest in the mysteries which evidently lurked far back in my family tree.", "Had I suspected their nature, how gladly I would have left Exham Priory to its moss, bats and cobwebs!", "My father died in 1904, but without any message to leave to me, or to my only child, Alfred, a motherless boy of ten.", "It was this boy who reversed the order of family information, for although I could give him only jesting conjectures about the past, he wrote me of some very interesting ancestral legends when the late war took him to England in 1917 as an aviation officer.", "Apparently the Delapores had a colourful and perhaps sinister history, for a friend of my son's, Capt. Edward Norrys of the Royal Flying Corps, dwelt near the family seat at Anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists could equal for wildness and incredibility.", "Norrys himself, of course, did not take them so seriously; but they amused my son and made good material for his letters to me.", "It was this legendry which definitely turned my attention to my transatlantic heritage, and made me resolve to purchase and restore the family seat which Norrys showed to Alfred in its picturesque desertion, and offered to get for him at a surprisingly reasonable figure, since his own uncle was the present owner.", "I bought Exham Priory in 1918, but was almost immediately distracted from my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed invalid.", "During the two years that he lived I thought of nothing but his care, having even placed my business under the direction of partners.", "In 1921, as I found myself bereaved and aimless, a retired manufacturer no longer young, I resolved to divert my remaining years with my new possession.", "Visiting Anchester in December, I was entertained by Capt. Norrys, a plump, amiable young man who had thought much of my son, and secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the coming restoration.", "Exham Priory itself I saw without emotion, a jumble of tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with rooks' nests, perched perilously upon a precipice, and denuded of floors or other interior features save the stone walls of the separate towers.", "As I gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when my ancestors left it over three centuries before, I began to hire workmen for the reconstruction.", "In every case I was forced to go outside the immediate locality, for the Anchester villagers had an almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the place.", "The sentiment was so great that it was sometimes communicated to the outside labourers, causing numerous desertions; whilst its scope appeared to include both the priory and its ancient family.", "My son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits because he was a de la Poer, and I now found myself subtly ostracized for a like reason until I convinced the peasants how little I knew of my heritage.", "Even then they sullenly disliked me, so that I had to collect most of the village traditions through the mediation of Norrys.", "What the people could not forgive, perhaps, was that I had come to restore a symbol so abhorrent to them; for, rationally or not, they viewed Exham Priory as nothing less than a haunt of fiends and werewolves.", "Piecing together the tales which Norrys collected for me, and supplementing them with the accounts of several savants who had studied the ruins, I deduced that Exham Priory stood on the site of a prehistoric temple; a Druidical or ante-Druidical thing which must have been contemporary with Stonehenge.", "That indescribable rites had been celebrated there, few doubted, and there were unpleasant tales of the transference of these rites into the Cybele worship which the Romans had introduced.", "Inscriptions still visible in the sub-cellar bore such unmistakable letters as \"DIV...", "OPS...", "MAGNA.", "MAT...\", sign of the Magna Mater whose dark worship was once vainly forbidden to Roman citizens.", "Anchester had been the camp of the third Augustan legion, as many remains attest, and it was said that the temple of Cybele was splendid and thronged with worshippers who performed nameless ceremonies at the bidding of a Phrygian priest.", "Tales added that the fall of the old religion did not end the orgies at the temple, but that the priests lived on in the new faith without real change.", "Likewise was it said that the rites did not vanish with the Roman power, and that certain among the Saxons added to what remained of the temple, and gave it the essential outline it subsequently preserved, making it the centre of a cult feared through half the heptarchy.", "About 1000 A.D.", "the place is mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial stone priory housing a strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by extensive gardens which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace.", "It was never destroyed by the Danes, though after the Norman Conquest it must have declined tremendously, since there was no impediment when Henry the Third granted the site to my ancestor, Gilbert de la Poer, First Baron Exham, in 1261.", "Of my family before this date there is no evil report, but something strange must have happened then.", "In one chronicle there is a reference to a de la Poer as \"cursed of God in 1307\", whilst village legendry had nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on the foundations of the old temple and priory.", "The fireside tales were of the most grisly description, all the ghastlier because of their frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness.", "They represented my ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom Gilles de Retz and the Marquis de Sade would seem the veriest tyros, and hinted whisperingly at their responsibility for the occasional disappearances of villagers through several generations.", "The worst characters, apparently, were the barons and their direct heirs; at least, most was whispered about these.", "If of healthier inclinations, it was said, an heir would early and mysteriously die to make way for another more typical scion.", "There seemed to be an inner cult in the family, presided over by the head of the house, and sometimes closed except to a few members.", "Temperament rather than ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult, for it was entered by several who married into the family.", "Lady Margaret Trevor from Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, the second son of the fifth baron, became a favourite bane of children all over the countryside, and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the Welsh border.", "Preserved in balladry, too, though not illustrating the same point, is the hideous tale of Lady Mary de la Poer, who shortly after her marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield was killed by him and his mother, both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world.", "These myths and ballads, typical as they were of crude superstition, repelled me greatly.", "Their persistence, and their application to so long a line of my ancestors, were especially annoying; whilst the imputations of monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the one known scandal of my immediate forebears\u2014the case of my cousin, young Randolph Delapore of Carfax who went among the negroes and became a voodoo priest after he returned from the Mexican War.", "I was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in the barren, windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff; of the graveyard stenches after the spring rains; of the floundering, squealing white thing on which Sir John Clave's horse had trod one night in a lonely field; and of the servant who had gone mad at what he saw in the priory in the full light of day.", "These things were hackneyed spectral lore, and I was at that time a pronounced sceptic.", "The accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed, though not especially significant in view of mediaeval custom.", "Prying curiosity meant death, and more than one severed head had been publicly shown on the bastions\u2014now effaced\u2014around Exham Priory.", "A few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque, and made me wish I had learnt more of the comparative mythology in my youth.", "There was, for instance, the belief that a legion of bat-winged devils kept witches' sabbath each night at the priory\u2014a legion whose sustenance might explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested in the vast gardens.", "And, most vivid of all, there was the dramatic epic of the rats\u2014the scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to desertion\u2014the lean, filthy, ravenous army which had swept all before it and devoured fowl, cats, dogs, hogs, sheep, and even two hapless human beings before its fury was spent.", "Around that unforgettable rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves, for it scattered among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its train.", "Such was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home.", "It must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment.", "On the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me.", "When the task was done, over two years after its commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscoted walls, vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration.", "Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations.", "The seat of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me.", "I could reside here permanently, and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend.", "My comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike.", "As I have said, I moved in on 16 July 1923.", "My household consisted of seven servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly fond.", "My eldest cat, \"Nigger-Man\", was seven years old and had come with me from my home in Bolton, Massachusetts; the others I had accumulated whilst living with Capt. Norrys' family during the restoration of the priory.", "For five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity, my time being spent mostly in the codification of old family data.", "I had now obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight of Walter de la Poer, which I conceived to be the probable contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at Carfax.", "It appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed all the other members of his household, except four servant confederates, in their sleep, about two weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his whole demeanour, but which, except by implication, he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who assisted him and afterwards fled beyond reach.", "This deliberate slaughter, which included a father, three brothers, and two sisters, was largely condoned by the villagers, and so slackly treated by the law that its perpetrator escaped honoured, unharmed, and undisguised to Virginia; the general whispered sentiment being that he had purged the land of an immemorial curse.", "What discovery had prompted an act so terrible, I could scarcely even conjecture.", "Walter de la Poer must have known for years the sinister tales about his family, so that this material could have given him no fresh impulse.", "Had he, then, witnessed some appalling ancient rite, or stumbled upon some frightful and revealing symbol in the priory or its vicinity?", "He was reputed to have been a shy, gentle youth in England.", "In Virginia he seemed not so much hard or bitter as harassed and apprehensive.", "He was spoken of in the diary of another gentleman adventurer, Francis Harley of Bellview, as a man of unexampled justice, honour, and delicacy.", "On 22 July occurred the first incident which, though lightly dismissed at the time, takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later events.", "It was so simple as to be almost negligible, and could not possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be recalled that since I was in a building practically fresh and new except for the walls, and surrounded by a well-balanced staff of servitors, apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality.", "What I afterward remembered is merely this\u2014that my old black cat, whose moods I know so well, was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character.", "He roved from room to room, restless and disturbed, and sniffed constantly about the walls which formed part of the Gothic structure.", "I realize how trite this sounds\u2014like the inevitable dog in the ghost story, which always growls before his master sees the sheeted figure\u2014yet I cannot consistently suppress it.", "The following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats in the house.", "He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the second storey, with groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple Gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and even as he spoke I saw the jetty form of Nigger-Man creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone.", "I told the man that there must be a singular odour or emanation from the old stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork.", "This I truly believed, and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats, I mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years, and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high walls, where they had never been known to stray.", "That afternoon I called on Capt. Norrys, and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented fashion.", "That night, dispensing as usual with a valet, I retired in the west tower chamber which I had chosen as my own, reached from the study by a stone staircase and short gallery\u2014the former partly ancient, the latter entirely restored.", "This room was circular, very high, and without wainscoting, being hung with arras which I had myself chosen in London.", "Seeing that Nigger-Man was with me, I shut the heavy Gothic door and retired by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly counterfeited candles, finally switching off the light and sinking on the carved and canopied four-poster, with the venerable cat in his accustomed place across my feet.", "I did not draw the curtains, but gazed out at the narrow window which I faced.", "There was a suspicion of aurora in the sky, and the delicate traceries of the window were pleasantly silhouetted.", "At some time I must have fallen quietly asleep, for I recall a distinct sense of leaving strange dreams, when the cat started violently from his placid position.", "I saw him in the faint auroral glow, head strained forward, fore feet on my ankles, and hind feet stretched behind.", "He was looking intensely at a point on the wall somewhat west of the window, a point which to my eye had nothing to mark it, but toward which all my attention was now directed.", "And as I watched, I knew that Nigger-Man was not vainly excited.", "Whether the arras actually moved I cannot say.", "I think it did, very slightly.", "But what I can swear to is that behind it I heard a low, distinct scurrying as of rats or mice.", "In a moment the cat had jumped bodily on the screening tapestry, bringing the affected section to the floor with his weight, and exposing a damp, ancient wall of stone; patched here and there by the restorers, and devoid of any trace of rodent prowlers.", "Nigger-Man raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall, clawing the fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw between the wall and the oaken floor.", "He found nothing, and after a time returned wearily to his place across my feet.", "I had not moved, but I did not sleep again that night.", "In the morning I questioned all the servants, and found that none of them had noticed anything unusual, save that the cook remembered the actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill.", "This cat had howled at some unknown hour of the night, awaking the cook in time for her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs.", "I drowsed away the noontime, and in the afternoon called again on Capt. Norrys, who became exceedingly interested in what I told him.", "The odd incidents\u2014so slight yet so curious\u2014appealed to his sense of the picturesque and elicited from him a number of reminiscenses of local ghostly lore.", "We were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats, and Norrys lent me some traps and Paris green, which I had the servants place in strategic localities when I returned.", "I retired early, being very sleepy, but was harassed by dreams of the most horrible sort.", "I seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a twilit grotto, knee-deep with filth, where a white-bearded daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous, flabby beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing.", "Then, as the swineherd paused and nodded over his task, a mighty swarm of rats rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man alike.", "From this terrific vision I was abruptly awakened by the motions of Nigger-Man, who had been sleeping as usual across my feet.", "This time I did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses, and of the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle, unconscious of their effect; for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive with nauseous sound\u2014the verminous slithering of ravenous, gigantic rats.", "There was now no aurora to show the state of the arras\u2014the fallen section of which had been replaced\u2014but I was not too frightened to switch on the light.", "As the bulbs leapt into radiance I saw a hideous shaking all over the tapestry, causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular dance of death.", "This motion disappeared almost at once, and the sound with it.", "Springing out of bed, I poked at the arras with the long handle of a warming-pan that rested near, and lifted one section to see what lay beneath.", "There was nothing but the patched stone wall, and even the cat had lost his tense realization of abnormal presences.", "When I examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room, I found all of the openings sprung, though no trace remained of what had been caught and had escaped.", "Further sleep was out of the question, so lighting a candle, I opened the door and went out in the gallery towards the stairs to my study, Nigger-Man following at my heels.", "Before we had reached the stone steps, however, the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the ancient flight.", "As I descended the stairs myself, I became suddenly aware of sounds in the great room below; sounds of a nature which could not be mistaken.", "The oak-panelled walls were alive with rats, scampering and milling whilst Nigger-Man was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter.", "Reaching the bottom, I switched on the light, which did not this time cause the noise to subside.", "The rats continued their riot, stampeding with such force and distinctness that I could finally assign to their motions a definite direction.", "These creatures, in numbers apparently inexhaustible, were engaged in one stupendous migration from inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably or inconceivably below.", "I now heard steps in the corridor, and in another moment two servants pushed open the massive door.", "They were searching the house for some unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several flights of stairs and squat, yowling, before the closed door to the sub-cellar.", "I asked them if they had heard the rats, but they replied in the negative.", "And when I turned to call their attention to the sounds in the panels, I realized that the noise had ceased.", "With the two men, I went down to the door of the sub-cellar, but found the cats already dispersed.", "Later I resolved to explore the crypt below, but for the present I merely made a round of the traps.", "All were sprung, yet all were tenantless.", "Satisfying myself that no one had heard the rats save the felines and me, I sat in my study till morning, thinking profoundly and recalling every scrap of legend I had unearthed concerning the building I inhabited.", "I slept some in the forenoon, leaning back in the one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval plan of furnishing could not banish.", "Later I telephoned to Capt.

not any mystic phosphorescence, but a filtered daylight which could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that over-looked the waste valley.", "That such fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly remarkable, for not only is the valley wholly uninhabited, but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an aeronaut could study its face in detail.", "A few steps more, and our breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally that Thornton, the psychic investigator, actually fainted in the arms of the dazed men who stood behind him.", "Norrys, his plump face utterly white and flabby, simply cried out inarticulately;

a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible suggestion.", "There were buildings and other architectural remains\u2014in one terrified glance I saw a weird pattern of tumuli, a savage circle of monoliths, a low-domed Roman ruin, a sprawling Saxon pile, and an early English edifice of wood\u2014but all these were dwarfed by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the ground.", "For yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones, or bones at least as human as those on the steps.", "Like a foamy sea they stretched, some fallen apart, but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons; these latter invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy, either fighting off some menace or clutching other forms with cannibal intent.", "When Dr Trask, the anthropologist, stopped to classify the skulls, he found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him.", "They were mostly lower than the Piltdown man in the scale of evolution, but in every case definitely human.", "Many were of higher grade, and a very few were the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types.", "All the bones were gnawed, mostly by rats, but somewhat by others of the half-human drove.", "Mixed with them were many tiny bones of rats\u2014fallen members of the lethal army which closed the ancient epic.", "I wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that hideous day of discovery.", "Not Hoffman nor Huysmans could conceive a scene more wildly incredible, more frenetically repellent, or more Gothically grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven staggered;

and that was the beginning of the end.", "Mr. Offord came down again, but the spell was broken, and the great sign of it was that the conversation was, for the first time, not directed.", "It wandered and stumbled, a little frightened, like a lost child\u2014it had let go the nurse's hand.", "\"The worst of it is that now we shall talk about my health\u2014c'est la fin de tout,\" Mr. Offord said, when he reappeared; and then I recognised what a sign of change that would be\u2014for he had never tolerated anything so provincial.", "The talk became ours, in a word\u2014not his; and as ours, even when he talked, it could only be inferior.", "In this form it was a distress to Brooksmith, whose attention now wandered from it altogether: he had so much closer a vision of his master's intimate conditions than our superficialities represented.", "There were better hours, and he was more in and out of the room, but I could see that he was conscious that the great institution was falling to pieces.", "He seemed to wish to take counsel with me about it, to feel responsible for its going on in some form or other.", "When for the second period\u2014the first had lasted several days\u2014he had to tell me that our old friend didn't receive, I half expected to hear him say after a moment: \"Do you think I ought to, sir, in his place?\"\u2014as he might have asked me, with the return of autumn, if I thought he had better light the drawing-room fire.", "He had a resigned philosophic sense of what his guests\u2014our guests, as I came to regard them in our colloquies\u2014would expect.", "His feeling was that he wouldn't absolutely have approved of himself as a substitute for the host; but he was so saturated with the religion of habit that he would have made, for our friends, the necessary sacrifice to the divinity.", "He would take them on a little further, till they could look about them.", "I think I saw him also mentally confronted with the opportunity to deal\u2014for once in his life\u2014with some of his own dumb preferences, his limitations of sympathy, weeding a little, in prospect, and returning to a purer tradition.", "It was not unknown to me that he considered that toward the end of Mr. Offord's career a certain laxity of selection had crept in.", "At last it came to be the case that we all found the closed door more often than the open one; but even when it was closed Brooksmith managed a crack for me to squeeze through; so that practically I never turned away without having paid a visit.", "The difference simply came to be that the visit was to Brooksmith.", "It took place in the hall, at the familiar foot of the stairs, and we didn't sit down\u2014at least Brooksmith didn't; moreover it was devoted wholly to one topic and always had the air of being already over\u2014beginning, as it were, at the end.", "But it was always interesting\u2014it always gave me something to think about.", "It is true that the subject of my meditation was ever the same\u2014ever \"It's all very well, but what will become of Brooksmith?\"", "Even my private answer to this question left me still unsatisfied.", "No doubt Mr. Offord would provide for him, but what would he provide?", "that was the great point.", "He couldn't provide society; and society had become a necessity of Brooksmith's nature.", "I must add that he never showed a symptom of what I may call sordid solicitude\u2014anxiety on his own account.", "He was rather livid and intensely grave, as befitted a man before whose eyes the \"shade of that which once was great\" was passing away.", "He had the solemnity of a person winding up, under depressing circumstances, a long established and celebrated business; he was a kind of social executor or liquidator.", "But his manner seemed to testify exclusively to the uncertainty of our future.", "I couldn't in those days have afforded it\u2014I lived in two rooms in Jermyn Street and didn't \"keep a man;\" but even if my income had permitted I shouldn't have ventured to say to Brooksmith (emulating Mr. Offord), \"My dear fellow, I'll take you on.\"", "The whole tone of our intercourse was so much more an implication that it was I who should now want a lift.", "Indeed there was a tacit assurance in Brooksmith's whole attitude that he would have me on his mind.", "One of the most assiduous members of our circle had been Lady Kenyon, and I remember his telling me one day that her ladyship had, in spite of her own infirmities, lately much aggravated, been in person to inquire.", "In answer to this I remarked that she would feel it more than any one.", "Brooksmith was silent a moment; at the end of which he said, in a certain tone (there is no reproducing some of his tones), \"I'll go and see her.\"", "I went to see her myself, and I learned that he had waited upon her; but when I said to her, in the form of a joke but with a core of earnest, that when all was over some of us ought to combine, to club together to set Brooksmith up on his own account, she replied a trifle disappointingly: \"Do you mean in a public-house?\"", "I looked at her in a way that I think Brooksmith himself would have approved, and then I answered: \"Yes, the Offord Arms.\"", "What I had meant, of course, was that, for the love of art itself, we ought to look to it that such a peculiar faculty and so much acquired experience should not be wasted.", "I really think that if we had caused a few black-edged cards to be struck off and circulated\u2014\"Mr.", "Brooksmith will continue to receive on the old premises from four to seven;

and when he went to \"see\" Lady Kenyon, for instance, it was to carry her the tribute of his receptive silence.", "Where would the speech of his betters have been if proper service had been a manifestation of sound?", "In that case the fundamental difference would have had to be shown by their dumbness, and many of them, poor things, were dumb enough without that provision.", "Brooksmith took an unfailing interest in the preservation of the fundamental difference; it was the thing he had most on his conscience.", "What had become of it, however, when Mr. Offord passed away like any inferior person\u2014was relegated to eternal stillness like a butler upstairs?", "His aspect for several days after the expected event may be imagined, and the multiplication by funereal observance of the things he didn't say.", "When everything was over\u2014it was late the same day\u2014I knocked at the door of the house of mourning as I so often had done before.", "I could never call on Mr. Offord again, but I had come, literally, to call on Brooksmith.", "I wanted to ask him if there was anything I could do for him, tainted with vagueness as this inquiry could only be.", "My wild dream of taking him into my own service had died away: my service was not worth his being taken into.", "My offer to him could only be to help him to find another place, and yet there was an indelicacy, as it were, in taking for granted that his thoughts would immediately be fixed on another.", "I had a hope that he would be able to give his life a different form\u2014though certainly not the form, the frequent result of such bereavements, of his setting up a little shop.", "That would have been dreadful; for I should have wished to further any enterprise that he might embark in, yet how could I have brought myself to go and pay him shillings and take back coppers over a counter?", "My visit then was simply an intended compliment.", "He took it as such, gratefully and with all the tact in the world.", "He knew I really couldn't help him and that I knew he knew I couldn't; but we discussed the situation\u2014with a good deal of elegant generality\u2014at the foot of the stairs, in the hall already dismantled, where I had so often discussed other situations with him.", "The executors were in possession, as was still more apparent when he made me pass for a few minutes into the dining-room, where various objects were muffled up for removal.", "Two definite facts, however, he had to communicate; one being that he was to leave the house for ever that night (servants, for some mysterious reason, seem always to depart by night), and the other\u2014he mentioned it only at the last, with hesitation\u2014that he had already been informed his late master had left him a legacy of eighty pounds.", "\"I'm very glad,\" I said, and Brooksmith rejoined: \"It was so like him to think of me.\"", "This was all that passed between us on the subject, and I know nothing of his judgment of Mr. Offord's memento.", "Eighty pounds are always eighty pounds, and no one has ever left me an equal sum; but, all the same, for Brooksmith, I was disappointed.", "I don't know what I had expected\u2014in short I was disappointed.", "Eighty pounds might stock a little shop\u2014a very little shop; but, I repeat, I couldn't bear to think of that.", "I asked my friend if he had been able to save a little, and he replied: \"No, sir; I have had to do things.\"", "I didn't inquire what things he had had to do; they were his own affair, and I took his word for them assentingly as if he had had the greatness of an ancient house to keep up; especially as there was something in his manner that seemed to convey a prospect of further sacrifice.", "\"I shall have to turn round a bit, sir\u2014I shall have to look about me,\" he said; and then he added, indulgently, magnanimously: \"If you should happen to hear of anything for me\" I couldn't let him finish; this was, in its essence, too much in the really grand manner.", "It would be a help to my getting him off my mind to be able to pretend I could find the right place, and that help he wished to give me, for it was doubtless painful to him to see me in so false a position.", "I interposed with a few words to the effect that I was well aware that wherever he should go, whatever he should do, he would miss our old friend terribly\u2014miss him even more than I should, having been with him so much more.", "This led him to make the speech that I have always remembered as the very text of the whole episode.", "\"Oh, sir, it's sad for you, very sad, indeed, and for a great many gentlemen and ladies; that it is, sir.", "But for me, sir, it is, if I may say so, still graver even than that: it's just the loss of something that was everything.", "For me, sir,\" he went on, with rising tears, \"he was just all, if you know what I mean, sir.", "You have others, sir, I daresay\u2014not that I would have you understand me to speak of them as in any way tantamount.", "But you have the pleasures of society, sir;

we'll look after you, we'll all do something for you.\"", "\"Ah, if you could give me some one like him!", "But there ain't two in the world,\" said Brooksmith as we parted.", "He had given me his address\u2014the place where he would be to be heard of.", "For a long time I had no occasion to make use of the information; for he proved indeed, on trial, a very difficult case.", "In a word the people who knew him and had known Mr. Offord, didn't want to take him, and yet I couldn't bear to try to thrust him among people who didn't know him.", "I spoke to many of our old friends about him, and I found them all governed by the odd mixture of feelings of which I myself was conscious, and disposed, further, to entertain a suspicion that he was \"spoiled,\" with which I then would have nothing to do.", "In plain terms a certain embarrassment, a sensible awkwardness, when they thought of it, attached to the idea of using him as a menial: they had met him so often in society.", "Many of them would have asked him, and did ask him, or rather did ask me to ask him, to come and see them;

for in this wretched life there is no wine of enjoyment without dregs of vexation, no rich broth of pleasure without the scum of annoyance; and just at this moment Filadoro's mother suddenly appeared, who was such an ugly ogress that Nature seemed to have formed her as a model of horrors; she had hair like a besom of holly, not fit indeed to cleanse houses of soot and cobwebs, but to sweep upon the hearts of all beholders the clouds of fright and terror; her forehead was a Genoa stone, to sharpen the dagger of fear which she stuck into all breasts; her eyes were comets, that predicted trembling of the legs, icy dread at the heart, and shuddering of the spirit; for she carried terror in her face, affright in her looks, horror in her steps, and dread in her words; her mouth had tusks like a boar's, was wide as an abyss, opening like that of a person who has the apoplexy, and slabbering like a mule's.", "In short, from head to foot she looked a quintessence of ugliness, an hospital of distempers;

and adding, that he ought not to lament his fate, which had led him to that house, where he was loved so dearly by her, and that he showed little return for her love by standing so in despair at what had happened.", "The prince replied, \"I am not grieved at having come down from the horse to the ass, nor at having exchanged the royal palace for this hovel, the splendid banquets for a crust of bread, the troop of servants for field-labour, the sceptre for a spade, nor at seeing myself, who have terrified armies, now frightened by this hideous scarecrow;

and, what is still worse, I have to do more than two oxen could get through in a day; and if I do not finish the task this evening, your mother will eat me up: yet withal I should not grieve so much to quit this wretched body as to be parted from so beautiful a creature.\"", "So saying he heaved sighs by bushels and shed tears by casksful.", "But Filadoro, drying his eyes, said to him, \"Fear not, my life, that my mother will touch a hair of your head;

but the trouble will soon pass, and we shall be happy.\"", "With these and a thousand other pleasant discourses the day passed; and when the ogress came back, she called to her daughter from the road, and said, \"Filadoro, let down your hair!\"", "for as the house had no staircase, she always ascended by her daughter's tresses.", "As soon as Filadoro heard her mother's voice, she unbound her hair and let fall her tresses, making a golden ladder to an iron heart: whereupon the old woman mounted up quickly and ran into the garden.", "But when she found it all dug and sown, she was beside herself with amazement; for it seemed to her impossible that a delicate lad should have accomplished such dog's labour.", "But the next morning, hardly had the Sun gone out to warm himself, on account of the cold he had caught in the river of India, when the ogress went down again, bidding Nardo Aniello take care that in the evening she should find ready split six stacks of wood which were in the cellar, with every log cleft into four pieces; or otherwise she would cut him up like bacon, and make a fry of him for supper.", "On hearing this decree the poor prince had like to have died of terror; and Filadoro, seeing him half-dead and pale as ashes, said, \"Why, what a coward you are to be frightened at such a trifle!\"", "\"Do you think it a trifle,\" replied Nardo Aniello, \"to split six stacks of wood, with every log cleft into four pieces, between this time and the evening?", "Alas!", "I shall sooner be cleft in halves myself, to fill the mouth of this horrid old woman.\"", "\"Fear not,\" answered Filadoro; \"for without your giving yourself any trouble, the wood shall all be split in good time; but meanwhile cheer up if you love me, and do not split my heart with such lamentation.\"", "Now when the Sun had shut up the shop of his rays, in order not to sell light to the Shades, the old woman returned, and bidding Filadoro let down the usual ladder, she ascended; and finding the wood all ready split, she began to suspect that it was her daughter who had given her this checkmate.", "And the third day, in order to make a third trial, she ordered the prince to clean out for her a cistern which held a thousand casks of water, for she wished to fill it anew; adding, that if the task were not finished by the evening she would make mincemeat of him.", "When the old woman went away, Nardo Aniello began again to weep and wail; and Filadoro, seeing that the labours increased, and that the old woman had something of the jackass in her to burden the poor fellow with such tasks and troubles, said to him, \"Be quiet, and as soon as the moment is past that interrupts my art, before the Sun says 'I am off,' we will say good-by to this house; sure enough this evening my mother shall find the land cleared, and I will go off with you, alive or dead.\"", "The prince, on hearing this news, opened his heart,\u2014all the more easily as he was before ready to burst; and embracing Filadoro he said, \"Thou art the pole-star of this storm-tossed bark, my soul!", "thou art the prop of my hopes.\"", "Now when evening drew nigh, Filadoro having dug a hole in the garden, under which there was a large underground passage, they went out and took the way to Naples.", "But when they arrived at the grotto of Pozzuolo, Nardo Aniello said to Filadoro, \"It will never do, my dear, for me to take you to the palace on foot and drest in this manner; therefore wait at this inn, and I will soon return with horses, carriages, servants and clothes.\"", "So Filadoro stayed behind, and the prince went his way to the city.", "Meanwhile the ogress returned home, and as Filadoro did not answer to her usual summons, she grew suspicious, ran into the wood, and cutting a great long pole, placed it against the window, and climbed up like a cat.", "Then she went into the house, and hunted everywhere, inside and out, high and low, but found no one: at last she perceived the hole, and seeing that it led into the open air, in her rage she did not leave a hair upon her head, cursing her daughter and the prince, and praying that at the first kiss Filadoro's lover should receive he might forget her.", "But let us leave the old woman to say her wicked paternosters, and return to the prince, who on arriving at the palace, where he was thought to be dead, put the whole house in an uproar, every one running to meet him and crying, \"Welcome, welcome!", "here he is safe and sound!", "how happy we are to see him back to this country!\"", "and a thousand other words of affection.", "But as he was going up the stairs, his mother met him half-way, and embraced and kissed him, saying, \"My son, my jewel, the apple of my eye, where have you been?", "how is it you have stayed away so long, to make us all die with anxiety?\"", "The prince knew not what to answer, for he did not wish to tell her his misfortunes; but no sooner had his mother kissed him with her poppy lips, than, owing to the curse of the ogress, all that had passed went from his memory.", "Then the queen told her son that, to put an end to his going to the chase and wasting his life in the woods, she wished to have him married.", "\"Well and good,\" replied the prince; \"I am ready and prepared to do all that my lady mother desires.\"\u2014\"Spoken", "like a blessed son!\" answered the queen.", "So it was settled that within four days they should lead home to him the bride, who was a lady of distinction just arrived in that city from the country of Flanders; and thereupon a great feasting and banquets were held.", "But meanwhile Filadoro, seeing that her husband stayed away so long, and hearing (I know not how) of the feast, the news of which had spread everywhere far and wide, waited in the evening till the servant-lad of the inn had gone to bed; and then taking his clothes from the head of the bed, she left her own in their place; and disguising herself like a man, she went to the court of the king, where the cooks, being in want of help as they had so much to do, took her as kitchen-boy.", "And when the appointed morning was come, at the hour when the Sun displays upon the counter of heaven the certificates given him by Nature, sealed with light, and sells secrets for sharpening the sight, the bride arrived with the sound of flutes and trumpets.", "Then the tables were set out, and they all took their seats; and just as the dishes were showering down, and the carver was cutting up a large English pie, which Filadoro had made with her own hands,", "lo! out flew such a beautiful dove, that the guests in their astonishment forgetting to eat, fell to admiring the pretty bird, which said to the prince in a piteous voice, \"Have you eaten the brains of a cat, O prince, that you have so soon forgotten the love of Filadoro?", "have all the services you received from her, ungrateful man, gone from your memory?", "is it thus you repay the benefits she has done you,\u2014she who took you out of the claws of the ogress, and gave you life and her own self too?", "is this the return you make to the unhappy maiden for all the love she has shown you?", "tell her to get up and be off!", "bid her pick this bone until the roast-meat come.", "Woe to the woman that trusts too much to the words of men, who ever requite kindness with ingratitude, benefits with thanklessness, and pay debts with forgetfulness!", "Just when the poor girl was imagining that she should live with you and share your fortunes, she is left and forsakenLiterally as follows:\u2014\"The poor girl was thinking of making the cake in the pan (?) with thee, and now she sees herself play at 'Cut the cake.\u2014(See note at page 34.);

and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.", "Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend.", "His reserve had been always excessive and habitual.", "I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science.", "I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.", "It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.", "I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the first singular impression.", "There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself.", "Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis.", "And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me.", "I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall, and the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.", "Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.", "Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.", "The discoloration of ages had been great.", "Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves.", "Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation.", "No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.", "In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air.", "Beyond  this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.", "Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.", "Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house.", "A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall.", "A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master.", "Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.", "While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebony blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up.", "On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family.", "His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity.", "He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.", "The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.", "The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.", "The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within.", "Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.", "Dark draperies hung upon the walls.", "The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered.", "Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene.", "I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.", "An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.", "Upon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world.", "A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity.", "We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe.", "Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!", "It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the man being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.", "Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable.", "A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.", "And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke.", "The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me.", "The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.", "In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence--an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation.", "For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament.", "His action was alternately vivacious and sullen.", "His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.", "It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him.", "He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady.", "It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off.", "It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations.", "Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight.", "He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.", "To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave.", "\"I shall perish,\" said he, \"I must perish in this deplorable folly.", "Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost.", "I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results.", "I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul.", "I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect--in terror.", "In this unnerved--in this pitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"  I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition.", "He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.", "He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued illness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly beloved sister--his sole companion for long years--his last and only relative on earth.", "\"Her decease,\" he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \"would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\"  While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared.", "I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread--and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings.", "A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.", "When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother--but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.", "The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians.", "A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.", "Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.", "For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.", "We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar.", "And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.", "I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.", "Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way.", "An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all.", "His long improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears.", "Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber.", "From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vagueness at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words.", "By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention.", "If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher.", "For me at least--in the circumstances then surrounding me--there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.", "One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words.", "A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device.", "Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth.", "No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.", "I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments.", "It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of the performances.", "But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for.", "They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement.", "The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered.", "I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne.", "The verses, which were entitled \"The Haunted Palace,\" ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:", "**In the greenest of our valleys,", "By good angels tenanted,", "Once a fair and stately palace--", "Radiant palace--reared its head.", "In the monarch Thought's dominion--", "It stood there!", "Never seraph spread a pinion", "Over fabric half so fair.", "Banners yellow, glorious, golden,", "On its roof did float and flow;", "(This--all this--was in the olden", "Time long ago)", "And every gentle air that dallied,", "In that sweet day,", "Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,", "A winged odour went away.", "Wanderers in that happy valley", "Through two luminous windows saw", "Spirits moving musically", "To a lute's well tuned law,", "Round about a throne, where sitting", "(Porphyrogene!)", "In state his glory well befitting,", "The ruler of the realm was seen.", "And all with pearl and ruby glowing", "Was the fair palace door,", "Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing", "And sparkling evermore,", "A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty", "Was but to sing,", "In voices of surpassing beauty,", "The wit and wisdom of their king.", "But evil things, in robes of sorrow,", "Assailed the monarch's high estate;", "(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow", "Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)", "And, round about his home, the glory", "That blushed and bloomed", "Is but a dim-remembered story,", "Of the old time entombed.", "And travellers now within that valley,", "Through the red-litten windows, see", "Vast forms that move fantastically", "To a discordant melody;", "While, like a rapid ghastly river,", "Through the pale door,", "A hideous throng rush out forever,", "And laugh--but smile no more.**", "I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty (for other men* have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it.", "This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.", "But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization.", "I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion.", "The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers.", "The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.", "Its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls.", "The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him--what he was.", "Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.", "Our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm.", "We pored together over such works as the Ververt et", "Chartreuse of Gresset;

and the City of the Sun by Campanella.", "One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours.", "His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual of a forgotten church--the Vigiliae Mortuorum Secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.", "I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment), in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building.", "The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute.", "The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family.", "I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.", "At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment.", "The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest.", "The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment.", "It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper.", "The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected.", "Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.", "Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant.", "A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them.", "Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could not regard her unawed.", "The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.", "We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.", "And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend.", "His ordinary manner had vanished.", "His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten.", "He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.", "The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out.", "The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance.", "There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage.", "At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.", "It was no wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me.", "I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.", "It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings.", "Sleep came not near my couch--while the hours waned and waned away.", "I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me.", "I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed.", "But my efforts were fruitless.", "An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm.", "Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.", "Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night,) and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.", "I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.", "I presently recognized it as that of Usher.", "In an instant afterwards he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.", "His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes--an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.", "His air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.", "\"And you have not seen it?\"", "he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence--\"you have not then seen it?--but, stay!", "you shall.\"", "Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.", "The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.", "It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty.", "A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance.", "I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars--nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning.", "But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.", "\"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.", "\"These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn.  Let us close this casement;--the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.", "Here is one of your favourite romances.", "I will read, and you shall listen;--and", "so we will pass away this terrible night together.\"", "The antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad Trist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.", "It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read.", "Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.", "I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force.", "Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:  \"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarmed and reverberated throughout the forest.\"", "At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described.", "It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me.", "I continued the story:  \"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which sat in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten--", "Who entereth herein, a conquerer hath bin;      Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;  and Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\"", "Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.", "Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion.", "I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour.", "From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.", "His head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.", "The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.", "Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:  \"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"", "No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.", "Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed.", "I rushed to the chair in which he sat.", "His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity.", "But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low,

speak!", "And now--to-night--Ethelred--ha!", "ha!--the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!", "Oh whither shall I fly?", "Will she not be here anon?", "Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste?", "Have I not heard her footsteps on the stair?", "Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?", "Madman!\"", "here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out

without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.", "There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame.", "For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold,--then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.", "From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.", "The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway.", "Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.", "The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base.", "While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \"House of Usher\""], "bn_03331799n": ["In a certain city there was a merchant and his wife and their son, who was wise beyond his years; he was called Vas\u00edli.", "Once all three were lunching together, and in a cage there was a Nightingale singing over the table, singing so woefully that the merchant could not bear it, and he said, \"If there ever were a man who could really tell me what that Nightingale is saying and the doom he is foreboding, I should like to meet him: I would give him in my life half of my possessions, and after my death I would bequeath him many goods.\"", "Then the little boy, who was only six years old, looked his father and mother fixedly in the eyes and said, \"I know what the Nightingale is singing, only I am frightened of saying it.\"", "\"Speak out openly,\" said the mother and father.", "And then Vas\u00edli said with tears, \"The Nightingale is foretelling that a time and season is coming when you will be my servants, when father will draw me water and mother will give me the towel to wipe my face and hands.\"", "These words made the merchant and his wife very angry, so they decided to get rid of their child; they built a little boat, and in the dark of night, put the sleeping boy into it and let it sail into the open sea.", "Just then the prophetic Nightingale flew out of its cage into the boat and sat on the boy's shoulder.", "Then the boat came to the sea-shore, and a ship came to meet it with all its sails spread.", "The master of the ship saw the boy, pitied him, adopted him, asked him questions, promised to keep and love him as if he were his own son.", "Next day the boy said to his new father, \"The Nightingale foretells that a storm is brewing which will break the masts and shatter the sails.", "You must go back to the haven.\"", "But the master of the ship would not go.", "And a storm arose at once, and the masts were shattered, and the sails torn down.", "It was no good, what is ended cannot be mended, so new masts were built and new sails were rigged.", "And they sailed on further.", "Again V\u00e1sya said, \"The Nightingale sings that there are twelve ships coming to meet us, all pirate ships, and they will take us prisoner.\"", "This time the master of the ship believed him, and returned to the island, and he saw the twelve bold pirates go sailing by.", "So the master of the ship waited as long as need be, and then sailed further.", "Some time went by, not too much, not too little, and the ship arrived at the city of Khvalynsk; and, for very many years, in front of the palace of the King of Khvalynsk, a Crow, with his wife and child, had been flying and screeching, giving no rest either by day or night.", "Whatever they did, whatever gins they might set, they could not drive them off from the window.", "Small shot was not any good.", "And so that King ordained that at every cross-road and at all the harbours this  notice should be exhibited:  \"If any man can drive away the Crow, with his wife and child, from the royal windows, the King will grant him as a reward half of his kingdom, and his youngest daughter as wife\u2014but if any shall undertake the work and shall not fulfil it he shall forfeit his head.\"", "Very many were the hunters eager to become kinsmen of the King, and all of their heads had been hewn off and hung on stakes, Now Vas\u00edli heard of this, went up and asked the master of the ship, \"Let me go to the King; possibly I can chase away the Crow and his wife.\"", "They endeavoured to deter him, but failed.", "\"Very well, go.", "And if you come by any harm, put the blame on yourself!\"", "So Vas\u00edli came into the palace, told the King, and

"Your Majesty, decide to whom it is the son belongs.\"", "The King answered, \"To the father.\"  As soon as the King had said this, the Crow with Master Crow sailed to the right, but", "Madam Crow to the left.", "After this the King took the youth unto himself, and he lived at the royal court and received the greatest kindness and honour, grew up and became a youth of youths, married the Princess,

were refreshing themselves, after a toilsome and fruitless quest for the Great Carbuncle.", "They had come thither, not as friends, nor partners in the enterprise, but each, save one youthful pair, impelled by his own selfish and solitary longing for this wondrous gem.", "Their feeling of brotherhood, however, was strong enough to induce them to contribute a mutual aid in building a rude hut of branches, and kindling a great fire of shattered pines, that had drifted down the headlong current of the Amonoosuck, on the lower bank of which they were to pass the night.", "There was but one of their number, perhaps, who had become so estranged from natural sympathies, by the absorbing spell of the pursuit, as to acknowledge no satisfaction at the sight of human faces, in the remote and solitary region whither they had ascended.", "A vast extent of wilderness lay between them and the nearest settlement, while scant a mile above their heads, was that bleak verge, where the hills throw off their shaggy mantle of forest trees, and either robe themselves in clouds, or tower naked into the sky.", "The roar of the Amonoosuck would have been too awful for endurance, if only a solitary man had listened, while the mountain stream talked with the wind.", "The adventurers, therefore, exchanged hospitable greetings, and welcomed one another to the hut, where each man was the host, and all were the guests of the whole company.", "They spread their individual supplies of food on the flat surface of a rock, and partook of a general repast; at the close of which, a sentiment of good fellowship was perceptible among the party, though repressed by the idea, that the renewed search for the Great Carbuncle must make them strangers again, in the morning.", "Seven men and one young woman, they warmed themselves together at the fire, which extended its bright wall along the whole front of their wigwam.", "As they observed the various and contrasted figures that made up the assemblage, each man looking like a caricature of himself, in the unsteady light that flickered over him, they came mutually to the conclusion, that an odder society had never met, in city or wilderness\u2014on mountain or plain.", "The eldest of the group, a tall, lean, weather-beaten man, some sixty years of age, was clad in the skins of wild animals, whose fashion of dress he did well to imitate, since the deer, the wolf, and the bear, had long been his most intimate companions.", "He was one of those ill-fated mortals, such as the Indians told of, whom, in their early youth, the Great Carbuncle smote with a peculiar madness, and became the passionate dream of their existence.", "All, who visited that region, knew him as the Seeker, and by no other name.", "As none could remember when he first took up the search, there went a fable in the valley of the Saco, that for his inordinate lust after the Great Carbuncle, he had been condemned to wander among the mountains till the end of time, still with the same feverish hopes at sunrise\u2014the same despair at eve.", "Near this miserable Seeker sat a little elderly personage, wearing a high crowned hat, shaped somewhat like a crucible.", "He was from beyond the sea, a Doctor Cacaphodel, who had wilted and dried himself into a mummy, by continually stooping over charcoal furnaces, and inhaling unwholesome fumes, during his researches in chemistry and alchymy.", "It was told of him, whether truly or not, that, at the commencement of his studies, he had drained his body of all its richest blood, and wasted it, with other inestimable ingredients, in an unsuccessful experiment\u2014and had never been a well man since.", "Another of the adventurers was Master Ichabod Pigsnort, a weighty merchant and selectman of Boston, and an elder of the famous Mr. Norton's church.", "His enemies had a ridiculous story, that Master Pigsnort was accustomed to spend a whole hour, after prayer-time, every morning and evening, in wallowing naked among an immense quantity of pine-tree shillings, which were the earliest silver coinage of Massachusetts.", "The fourth, whom we shall notice, had no name, that his companions knew of, and was chiefly distinguished by a sneer that always contorted his thin visage, and by a prodigious pair of spectacles, which were supposed to deform and discolor the whole face of nature, to this gentleman's perception.", "The fifth adventurer likewise lacked a name, which was the greater pity, as he appeared to be a poet.", "He was a bright-eyed man, but wofully pined away, which was no more than natural, if, as some people affirmed, his ordinary diet was fog, morning mist, and a slice of the densest cloud within his reach, sauced with moonshine, whenever he could get it.", "Certain it is, that the poetry, which flowed from him, had a smack of all these dainties.", "The sixth of the party was a young man of haughty mien, and sat somewhat apart from the rest, wearing his plumed hat loftily among his elders, while the fire glittered on the rich embroidery of his dress, and gleamed intensely on the jeweled pommel of his sword.", "This was the Lord de Vere, who, when at home, was said to spend much of his time in the burial-vault of his dead progenitors, rummaging their mouldy coffins in search of all the earthly pride and vain-glory, that was hidden among bones and dust; so that, besides his own share, he had the collected haughtiness of his whole line of ancestry.", "Lastly, there was a handsome youth in rustic garb, and by his side, a blooming little person, in whom a delicate shade of maiden reserve was just melting into the rich glow of a young wife's affection.", "Her name was Hannah, and her husband's Matthew; two homely names, yet well enough adapted to the simple pair, who seemed strangely out of place among the whimsical fraternity whose wits had been set agog by the Great Carbuncle.", "Beneath the shelter of one hut, in the bright blaze of the same fire, sat this varied group of adventurers, all so intent upon a single object, that, of whatever else they began to speak, their closing words were sure to be illuminated with the Great Carbuncle.", "Several related the circumstances that brought them thither.", "One had listened to a traveller's tale of this marvelous stone, in his own distant country, and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding it, as could only be quenched in its intensest lustre.", "Another, so long ago as when the famous Captain Smith visited these coasts, had seen it blazing far at sea, and had felt no rest in all the intervening years, till now that he took up the search.", "A third, being encamped on a hunting expedition, full forty miles south of the White Mountains, awoke at midnight, and beheld the Great Carbuncle gleaming like a meteor, so that the shadows of the trees fell backward from it.", "They spoke of the innumerable attempts, which had been made to reach the spot, and of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success from all adventurers, though it might seem so easy to follow to its source a light that overpowered the moon, and almost matched the sun.", "It was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every other, in anticipating better fortune than the past, yet nourished a scarcely hidden conviction, that he would himself be the favored one.", "As if to allay their too sanguine hopes, they recurred to the Indian traditions, that a spirit kept watch about the gem, and bewildered those who sought it, either by removing it from peak to peak of the higher hills, or by calling up a mist from the enchanted lake over which it hung.", "But these tales were deemed unworthy of credit; all professing to believe, that the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or perseverance in the adventurers, or such other causes as might naturally obstruct the passage to any given point, among the intricacies of forest, valley, and mountain.", "In a pause of the conversation, the wearer of the prodigious spectacles looked round upon the party, making each individual, in turn, the object of the sneer which invariably dwelt upon his countenance.", "'So, fellow-pilgrims,' said he, 'here we are, seven wise men and one fair damsel\u2014who, doubtless, is as wise as any gray-beard of the company: here we are, I say, all bound on the same goodly enterprise.", "Methinks now, it were not amiss, that each of us declare what he proposes to do with the Great Carbuncle, provided he have the good hap to clutch it.", "What says our friend in the bear-skin?", "How mean you, good sir, to enjoy the prize which you have been seeking, the Lord knows how long, among the Crystal Hills?'", "'How enjoy it!'", "exclaimed the aged Seeker, bitterly.", "'I hope for no enjoyment from it\u2014that folly has past long ago!", "I keep up the search for this accursed stone, because the vain ambition of my youth has become a fate upon me, in old age.", "The pursuit alone is my strength\u2014the energy of my soul\u2014the warmth of my blood, and the pith and marrow of my bones!", "Were I to turn my back upon it, I should fall down dead, on the hither side of the Notch, which is the gateway of this mountain region.", "Yet, not to have my wasted life-time back again, would I give up my hopes of the Great Carbuncle!", "Having found it, I shall bear it to a certain cavern that I wot of, and there, grasping it in my arms, lie down and die, and keep it buried with me for ever.'", "'Oh, wretch, regardless of the interests of science!' cried Doctor Cacaphodel, with philosophic indignation.", "'Thou art not worthy to behold, even from afar off, the lustre of this most precious gem that ever was concocted in the laboratory of Nature.", "Mine is the sole purpose for which a wise man may desire the possession of the Great Carbuncle.", "Immediately on obtaining it\u2014for I have a presentiment, good people, that the prize is reserved to crown my scientific reputation\u2014I shall return to Europe, and employ my remaining years in reducing it to its first elements.", "A portion of the stone will I grind to impalpable powder;  parts shall be dissolved in acids, or whatever solvents will act upon so admirable a composition; and the remainder I design to melt in the crucible, or set on fire with the blow-pipe.", "By these various methods, I shall gain an accurate analysis, and finally bestow the result of my labors upon the world, in a folio volume.'", "'Excellent!' quoth the man with the spectacles.", "'Nor need you hesitate, learned sir, on account of the necessary destruction of the gem; since the perusal of your folio may teach every mother's son of us to concoct a Great Carbuncle of his own.'", "'But, verily,' said Master Ichabod Pigsnort, 'for mine own part, I object to the making of these counterfeits, as being calculated to reduce the marketable value of the true gem.", "I tell ye frankly, sirs, I have an interest in keeping up the price.", "Here have I quitted my regular traffic, leaving my warehouse in the care of my clerks, and putting my credit to great hazard, and furthermore, have put myself in peril of death or captivity by the accursed heathen savages\u2014 and all this without daring to ask the prayers of the congregation, because the quest for the Great Carbuncle is deemed little better than a traffic with the evil one.", "Now think ye that I would have done this grievous wrong to my soul, body, reputation and estate, without a reasonable chance of profit?'", "'Not I, pious Master Pigsnort,' said the man with the spectacles.", "'I never laid such a great folly to thy charge.'", "'Truly, I hope not,' said the merchant.", "'", "Now, as touching this Great Carbuncle, I am free to own that I have never had a glimpse of it; but be it only the hundredth part so bright as people tell, it will surely outvalue the Great Mogul's best diamond, which he holds at an incalculable sum.", "Wherefore, I am minded to put the Great Carbuncle on shipboard, and voyage with it to England, France, Spain, Italy, or into Heathendom, if Providence should send me thither, and, in a word, dispose of the gem to the best bidder among the potentates of the earth, that he may place it among his crown jewels.", "If any of ye have a wiser plan, let him expound it.'", "'That have I, thou sordid man!' exclaimed the poet.", "'Dost thou desire nothing brighter than gold, that thou wouldst transmute all this ethereal lustre into such dross, as thou wallowest in already?", "For myself, hiding the jewel under my cloak, I shall hie me back to my attick chamber, in one of the darksome alleys of London.", "There, night and day, will I gaze upon it\u2014my soul shall drink its radiance\u2014it shall be diffused throughout my intellectual powers, and gleam brightly in every line of poesy that I indite.", "Thus, long ages after I am gone, the splendor of the Great Carbuncle will blaze around my name!'", "'Well said, Master Poet!' cried he of the spectacles.", "'Hide it under thy cloak, say'st thou?", "Why, it will gleam through the holes, and make thee look like a jack-o'lantern!'", "'To think!'", "ejaculated the Lord de Vere, rather to himself, than his companions, the best of whom he held utterly unworthy of his intercourse,\u2014'to think that a fellow in a tattered cloak should talk of conveying the Great Carbuncle to a garret in Grub street!", "Have not I resolved within myself, that the whole earth contains no fitter ornament for the great hall of my ancestral castle?", "There shall it flame for ages, making a noonday of midnight, glittering on the suits of armor, the banners, and escutcheons, that hang around the wall, and keeping bright the memory of heroes.", "Wherefore have all other adventurers sought the prize in vain, but that I might win it, and make it a symbol of the glories of our lofty line?", "And never, on the diadem of the White Mountains, did the Great Carbuncle hold a place half so honored, as is reserved for it in the hall of the de Veres!'", "'It is a noble thought,' said the Cynic, with an obsequious sneer.", "'Yet might I presume to say so, the gem would make a rare sepulchral lamp, and would display the glories of your lordship's progenitors more truly in, the ancestral vault, than in the castle hall.'", "'Nay forsooth,' observed Matthew, the young rustic, who sat hand in hand with his bride, 'the gentleman has bethought himself of a profitable use for this bright stone.", "Hannah here and I are seeking it for a like purpose.'", "'How, fellow!' exclaimed his lordship, in surprise.", "'What castle hall hast thou to hang it in?'", "'No castle,' replied Matthew, 'but as neat a cottage as any within sight of the Crystal Hills.", "Ye must know, friends, that Hannah and I, being wedded the last week, have taken up the search of the Great Carbuncle, because we shall need its light in the long winter evenings; and it will be such a pretty thing to show the neighbors, when they visit us.", "It will shine through the house, so that we may pick up a pin in any corner, and will set all the windows a-glowing, as if there were a great fire of pine knots in the chimney.", "And then how pleasant, when we awake in the night, to be able to see one another's faces!'", "There was a general smile among the adventurers, at the simplicity of the young couple's project, in regard to this wondrous and invaluable stone, with which the greatest monarch on earth might have been proud to adorn his palace.", "Especially the man with spectacles, who had sneered at all the company in turn, now twisted his visage into such an expression of ill-natured mirth, that Matthew asked him, rather peevishly, what he himself meant to do with the Great Carbuncle.", "'The Great Carbuncle!' answered the Cynic, with ineffable scorn.", "'Why, you blockhead, there is no such thing, in rerum natur\u00e2.", "I have come three thousand miles, and am resolved to set my foot on every peak of these mountains, and poke my head into every chasm, for the sole purpose of demonstrating to the satisfaction of any man, one whit less an ass than thyself, that the Great Carbuncle is all a humbug!'", "Vain and foolish were the motives that had brought most of the adventurers to the Crystal Hills, but none so vain, so foolish, and so impious too, as that of the scoffer with the prodigious spectacles.", "He was one of those wretched and evil men, whose yearnings are downward to the darkness, instead of Heavenward, and who, could they but extinguish the lights which God hath kindled for us, would count the midnight gloom their chiefest glory.", "As the Cynic spoke, several of the party were startled by a gleam of red splendor, that showed the huge shapes of the surrounding mountains, and the rock-bestrewn bed of the turbulent river, with an illumination unlike that of their fire, on the trunks and black boughs of the forest trees.", "They listened for the roll of thunder, but heard nothing, and were glad that the tempest came not near them.", "The stars, those dial-points of Heaven, now warned the adventurers to close their eyes on the blazing logs, and open them, in dreams, to the glow of the Great Carbuncle.", "The young married couple had taken their lodgings in the furthest corner of the wigwam, and were   from the rest of the party by a curtain of curiously woven twigs, such as might have hung, in deep festoons around the bridal bower of Eve.", "The modest little wife had wrought this piece of tapestry, while the other guests were talking.", "She and her husband fell asleep with hands tenderly clasped, and awoke, from visions of unearthly radiance, to meet the more blessed light of one another's eyes.", "They awoke at the same instant, and with one happy smile beaming over their two faces, which grew brighter, with their consciousness of the reality of life and love.", "But no sooner did she recollect where they were, than the bride peeped through the interstices of the leafy curtain, and saw that the outer room of the hut was deserted.", "'Up, dear Matthew!' cried she, in haste.", "'The strange folk are all gone!", "Up, this very minute, or we shall lose the Great Carbuncle!'", "In truth, so little did these poor young people deserve the mighty prize which had lured them thither, that they had slept peacefully all night, and till the summits of the hills were glittering with sunshine; while the other adventurers had tossed their limbs in feverish wakefulness, or dreamed of climbing precipices, and set off to realize their dreams with the earliest peep of dawn.", "But Matthew and Hannah, after their calm rest, were as light as two young deer, and merely stopped to say their prayers, and wash themselves in a cold pool of the Amonoosuck, and then to taste a morsel of food, ere they turned their faces to the   side.", "It was a sweet emblem of conjugal affection, as they toiled up the difficult ascent, gathering strength from the mutual aid which they afforded.", "After several little accidents, such as a torn robe, a lost shoe, and the entanglement of Hannah's hair in a bough, they reached the upper verge of the forest, and were now to pursue a more adventurous course.", "The innumerable trunks and heavy foliage of the trees had hitherto shut in their thoughts, which now shrank affrighted from the region of wind, and cloud, and naked rocks, and desolate sunshine, that rose immeasurably above them.", "They gazed back at the obscure wilderness which they had traversed, and longed to be buried again in its depths, rather than trust themselves to so vast and visible a solitude.", "'Shall we go on?' said Matthew, throwing his arm round Hannah's waist, both to protect her, and to comfort his heart by drawing her close to it.", "But the little bride, simple as she was, had a woman's love of jewels, and could not forego the hope of possessing the very brightest in the world, in spite of the perils with which it must be won.", "'Let us climb a little higher,' whispered she, yet tremulously, as she turned her face upward to the lonely sky.", "'Come then,' said Matthew, mustering his manly courage, and drawing her along with him; for she became timid again, the moment that he grew bold.", "And upward, accordingly, went the pilgrims of the Great Carbuncle, now treading upon the tops and thickly interwoven branches of dwarf pines, which, by the growth of centuries, though mossy with age, had barely reached three feet in altitude.", "Next, they came to masses and fragments of naked rock, heaped confusedly together, like a cairn reared by giants, in memory of a giant chief.", "In this bleak realm of upper air, nothing breathed, nothing grew; there was no life but what was concentred in their two hearts; they had climbed so high, that Nature herself seemed no longer to keep them company.", "She lingered beneath them, within the verge of the forest trees, and sent a farewell glance after her children, as they strayed where her own green foot-prints had never been.", "But soon they were to be hidden from her eye.", "Densely and dark, the mists began to gather below, casting black spots of shadow on the vast landscape, and sailing heavily to one centre, as if the loftiest mountain-peak had summoned a council of its kindred clouds.", "Finally, the vapors welded themselves, as it were, into a mass, presenting the appearance of a pavement over which the wanderers might have trodden, but where they would vainly have sought an avenue to the blessed earth which they had lost.", "And the lovers yearned to behold that green earth again, more intensely, alas!", "than, beneath a clouded sky, they had ever desired a glimpse of Heaven.", "They even felt it a relief to their desolation, when the mists, creeping gradually up the mountain, concealed its lonely peak, and thus  , at least for them, the whole region of visible space.", "But they drew closer together, with a fond and melancholy gaze, dreading lest the universal cloud should snatch them from each other's sight.", "Still, perhaps, they would have been resolute to climb as far and as high, between earth and heaven, as they could find foot-hold, if Hannah's strength had not begun to fail, and with that, her courage also.", "Her breath grew short.", "She refused to burthen her husband with her weight, but often tottered against his side, and recovered herself each time by a feebler effort.", "At last, she sank down on one of the rocky steps of the acclivity.", "'We are lost, dear Matthew,' said she, mournfully, 'We shall never find our way to the earth again.", "And, oh, how happy we might have been in our cottage!'", "'Dear heart!\u2014we will yet be happy there,' answered Matthew.", "'Look!", "In this direction, the sunshine penetrates the dismal mist.", "By its aid, I can direct our course to the passage of the Notch.", "Let us go back, love, and dream no more of the Great Carbuncle!'", "'The sun cannot be yonder,' said Hannah, with despondence.", "'", "By this time, it must be noon.", "If there could ever be any sunshine here, it would come from above our heads.'", "'But, look!' repeated Matthew, in a somewhat altered tone.", "'It is brightening every moment.", "If not sunshine, what can it be?'", "Nor could the young bride any longer deny, that a radiance was breaking through the mist, and changing its dim hue to a dusky red, which continually grew more vivid, as if brilliant particles were interfused with the gloom.", "Now, also, the cloud began to roll away from the mountain, while, as it heavily withdrew, one object after another started out of its impenetrable obscurity into sight, with precisely the effect of a new creation, before the indistinctness of the old chaos had been completely swallowed up.", "As the process went on, they saw the gleaming of water close at their feet, and found themselves on the very border of a mountain-lake, deep, bright, clear, and calmly beautiful, spreading from brim to brim of a basin that had been scooped out of the solid rock.", "A ray of glory flashed across its surface.", "The pilgrims looked whence it should proceed, but closed their eyes with a thrill of awful admiration, to exclude the fervid splendor that glowed from the brow of a cliff, impending over the enchanted lake.", "For the simple pair had reached that lake of mystery, and found the long-sought shrine of the Great Carbuncle!", "They threw their arms around each other, and trembled at their own success; for as the legends of this wondrous gem rushed thick upon their memory, they felt themselves marked out by fate\u2014and the consciousness was fearful.", "Often, from childhood upward, they had seen it shining like a distant star.", "And now that star was throwing its intensest lustre on their hearts.", "They seemed changed to one another's eyes, in the red brilliancy that flamed upon their cheeks, while it lent the same fire to the lake, the rocks, and sky, and to the mists which had rolled back before its power.", "But, with their next glance, they beheld an object that drew their attention even from the mighty stone.", "At the base of the cliff, directly beneath the Great Carbuncle, appeared the figure of a man, with his arms extended in the act of climbing, and his face turned upward, as if to drink the full gush of splendor.", "But he stirred not, no more than if changed to marble.", "'It is the Seeker,' whispered Hannah, convulsively grasping her husband's arm.", "'Matthew, he is dead!'", "'The joy of success has killed him,' replied Matthew, trembling violently.", "'Or perhaps the very light of the Great Carbuncle was death!'", "'The Great Carbuncle,' cried a peevish voice behind them.", "'The Great Humbug!", "If you have found it,

those abominable spectacles, and you cannot help seeing it!'", "Now these colored spectacles probably darkened the Cynic's sight, in at least as great a degree as the smoked glasses through which people gaze at an eclipse.", "With resolute bravado, however, he snatched them from his nose, and fixed a bold stare full upon the ruddy blaze of the Great Carbuncle.", "But, scarcely had he encountered it, when, with a deep, shuddering groan, he dropt his head, and pressed both hands across his miserable eyes.", "Thenceforth there was, in very truth, no light of the Great Carbuncle, nor any other light on earth, nor light of Heaven itself, for the poor Cynic.", "So long accustomed to view all objects through a medium that deprived them of every glimpse of brightness, a single flash of so glorious a phenomenon, striking upon his naked vision, had blinded him for ever.", "'Matthew,' said Hannah, clinging to him, 'let us go hence!'", "Matthew saw that she was faint, and kneeling down, supported her in his arms, while he threw some of the thrillingly-cold water of the enchanted lake upon her face and bosom.", "It revived her, but could not renovate her courage.", "'Yes,

our window.", "We will kindle the cheerful glow of our hearth, at eventide, and be happy in its light.", "But never again will we desire more light than all the world may share with us.'", "'No,' said his bride, 'for how could we live by day, or sleep by night, in this awful blaze of the Great Carbuncle!'", "Out of the hollow of their hands, they drank each a draught from the lake, which presented them its waters uncontaminated by an earthly lip.", "Then, lending their guidance to the blinded Cynic, who uttered not a word, and even stifled his groans in his own most wretched heart, they began to descend the mountain.", "Yet, as they left the shore, till then untrodden, of the Spirit's lake, they threw a farewell glance towards the cliff, and beheld the vapors gathering in dense volumes, through which the gem burned duskily.", "As touching the other pilgrims of the Great Carbuncle, the legend goes on to tell, that the worshipful Master Ichabod Pigsnort soon gave up the quest, as a desperate speculation, and wisely resolved to betake himself again to his warehouse, near the town-dock, in Boston.", "But, as he passed through the Notch of the mountains, a war party of Indians

result of his experiments in one of the heaviest folios of the day.", "And, for all these purposes, the gem itself could not have answered better than the granite.", "The poet, by a somewhat similar mistake, made prize of a great piece of ice, which he found in a sunless chasm of the mountains, and swore that it corresponded, in all points, with his idea of the Great Carbuncle.", "The critics say, that, if his poetry lacked the splendor of the gem, it retained all the coldness of the ice.", "The Lord de Vere went back to his ancestral hall, where he contented himself with a wax-lighted chandelier, and filled, in due course of time, another coffin in the ancestral vault.", "As the funeral torches gleamed within that dark receptacle, there was no need of the Great Carbuncle to shew the vanity of earthly pomp.", "The Cynic, having cast aside his spectacles, wandered about the world, a miserable object, and was punished with an agonizing desire of light, for the wilful blindness of his former life.", "The whole night long, he would lift his splendor-blasted orbs to the moon and stars; he turned his face eastward, at sunrise, as duly as a Persian idolater; he made a pilgrimage to Rome, to witness the magnificent illumination of Saint Peter's church; and finally perished in the great fire of London, into the midst of which he had thrust himself, with the desperate idea of catching one feeble ray from the blaze, that was kindling earth and heaven.", "Matthew and his bride spent many peaceful years, and were fond of telling the legend of the Great Carbuncle.", "The tale, however, towards the close of their lengthened lives, did not meet with the full credence that had been accorded to it by those, who remembered the ancient lustre of the gem.", "For it is affirmed, that, from the hour when two mortals had shown themselves so simply wise, as to reject a jewel which would have dimmed all earthly things, its splendor waned.", "When other pilgrims reached the cliff, they found only an opaque stone, with particles of mica glittering on its surface.", "There is also a tradition that, as the youthful pair departed, the gem was loosened from the forehead of the cliff, and fell into the enchanted lake, and that, at noontide, the Seeker's form may still be seen to bend over its quenchless gleam.", "Some few believe that this inestimable stone is blazing, as of old, and say that they have caught its radiance, like a flash of summer lightning, far down the valley of the Saco.", "And be it owned, that, many a mile from the Crystal Hills, I saw a wondrous light

counsellings they came to the conclusion, that a great peril awaited her from a piece of stalk in some flax.", "Thereupon he issued a command, prohibiting any flax or hemp, or such-like thing, to be brought into his house, hoping thus to avoid the danger.", "When Talia was grown up, and was standing one day at the window, she saw an old woman pass by who was spinning; and never having seen a distaff or a spindle, and being vastly pleased with the twisting and twirling of the thread, her curiosity was so great that she made the old woman come upstairs.", "Then taking the distaff in her hand Talia began to draw out the thread, when by mischance a piece of stalk in the flax getting under her fingernail, she fell dead upon the ground; at which sight the old woman hobbled downstairs as quickly as she could.", "When the unhappy father heard of the disaster that had befallen Talia, after paying for this cask of AsprinoA sour Neapolitan wine.", "with a barrel of tears, he placed her in that palace in the country, upon a velvet seat under a canopy of brocade; and fastening the doors, he quitted for ever that place which had been the cause of such misfortune to him, in order to drive all remembrance of it from his mind.", "Now a certain king happened to go one day to the chace, and a falcon escaping from him flew in at a window of that palace.", "When the king found that the bird did not return at his call, he ordered his attendants to knock at the door, thinking that the palace was inhabited; and after knocking for some time, the king ordered them to fetch a vinedresser's ladder, wishing himself to scale the house and see what was inside.", "Then he mounted the ladder, and going through the whole palace, he stood aghast and looked just like a mummy, at not finding there any living person.", "At last he came to the room where Talia was lying, as if enchanted; and when the king saw her, he called to her, thinking that she was asleep, but in vain, for she still slept on, however loud he called.", "So, after admiring her beauty awhile, the king returned home to his kingdom, where for a long time he forgot all that had happened.", "Meanwhile Talia gave birth to little twins, one a boy and the other a girl, who looked like two little jewels; and two fairies appeared in the palace, who took care of the children, and placed them at their mother's breast.", "But once, when they wanted to suck, not finding the breast, they seized by mistake her finger, and went on sucking until they drew out the splinter.", "Thereupon she seemed to awake as from a deep sleep; and when she saw those little jewels at her side, she took them to her heart, and loved them more than her life; but she wondered greatly at seeing herself quite alone in the palace with the two children, and food and refreshment brought her by unseen hands.", "After a time the king, calling Talia to mind, took occasion one day when he went to the chace to go and see her; and when he found her awakened, and with two beautiful little creatures by her side, he was struck dumb with rapture.", "Then the king told Talia who he was, and they formed a great league and friendship, and he

I will make you rich; but if you conceal the truth from me, I'll make you rue it.\"", "The man, moved on the one side by fear, and on the other pricked by interest, which is a bandage to the eyes of honour, the blind of justice, and an old horseshoe to trip up good-faith, told the queen the whole truth, calling bread bread and wine wine.", "Whereupon she sent the secretary in the king\u2019s name to Talia, saying that he wished to see the children.", "Then Talia sent them with great joy; but the queen, with the heart of a Medea, commanded the cook to kill them, and serve them up in various ways for her wretched husband to eat.", "Now the cook, who had a tender heart, seeing the two pretty little golden pippins, took compassion on them, and gave them to his wife, bidding her keep them concealed: then he killed and dressed two little kids in a hundred different ways.", "When the king came, the queen quickly ordered the dishes to be served up; and the king fell to eating with great delight, exclaiming, \"By the life of LanfusaThe mother of Ferra\u00f9,\u2014see Orlando Furioso, i. 30.", "The habit of swearing by an object the dearest to a person is quite Spanish, as is also the

brought nothing to the house.\"", "And at last getting up in a rage, he went off to a villa at a little distance to cool his anger.", "Meanwhile the queen, not satisfied with what she had done, called the secretary again, and sent him to fetch Talia, pretending that the king wished to see her.", "At this summons Talia went that very instant, longing to see the light of her eyes, and not knowing that only the smoke awaited her.", "But when she came before the queen, the latter said to her, with the face of a Nero and full of poison as a viper, \"Welcome, Madam Slycheat!", "are you indeed the pretty mischief-maker?", "are you the weed that has caught my husband\u2019s eye and given me all this trouble?", "So so, you are come at last to purgatory, where I'll make you pay for all the ill you have done me.\"", "When Talia heard this she began to excuse herself; but the queen would not listen to a word; and having a large fire lighted in the courtyard, she commanded that Talia should be thrown into the flames.", "Poor Talia, seeing matters come to a bad pass, fell on her knees before the queen, and besought her at least to grant her time to take the clothes from off her back.", "Whereupon the queen, not so much out of pity for the unhappy girl, as to get possession of her dress, which was embroidered all over with gold and pearls, said to her, \"Undress yourself\u2014I allow you.\"", "Then Talia began to undress, and as she took off each garment she uttered an exclamation of grief; and when she had stripped off her cloak, her gown and her jacket, and was proceeding to take off her petticoat, they seized her and were dragging her away.", "At that moment the king came up, and seeing the spectacle he demanded to know the whole truth; and when he asked for the children, and heard that his wife had ordered them to be killed, in revenge for his unfaithfulness, the unhappy king gave himself up to despair, exclaiming, \"Alas then, I have myself been the wolf to my little lambs!", "Woe is me!", "why did not my veins recognize that they were the fountain of their blood?", "Ah, renegade Turk, what barbarous act have you done?", "but your wickedness shall be punished; you shall do penance without being sent to the Coliseum.\"", "So saying he ordered her to be thrown into the same fire which had been lighted for Talia, and the secretary with her, who was the handle of this cruel game and the weaver of this wicked web.", "Then he was going to do the same with the cook, thinking that he had killed the children; but the cook threw himself at the king's feet and said, \"Truly, sir king, I would desire no other sinecure in return for the service I have done you than to be thrown into a furnace full of live coals, I would ask no other gratuity than the thrust of a spike, I would wish for no other amusement than to be roasted in the fire, I would desire no other privilege than to have the ashes of a cook mingled with those of a queen.", "But I look for no such great reward for having saved your children, and brought them back to you in spite of that wicked creature who wished to kill them.\"", "When the king heard these words he was quite   himself; he appeared to dream, and could not believe what his ears had heard.", "Then he said to the cook, \"If it is true that you have saved the children, be assured I will take you from turning the spit, and place you in the kitchen of this breast, to turn my will as you please, rewarding you so that you shall call yourself the happiest man in the world.\"", "As the king was speaking these words, the wife of the cook, seeing the dilemma her husband was in, brought Sun and Moon before the King, who playing at the game of three with his wife and children, went round and round kissing first one and then another.", "Then giving the cook a large reward, he made him his chamberlain: and he took Talia to wife, who enjoyed a long life with her husband and children, acknowledging that",

the witch was really his wife, and he did not know that his wife was the sheep; so he went home with her, glad at heart because his sheep was found.", "When they were safe at home the witch said to the man: 'Look here, old man, we must really kill that sheep lest it run away to the wood again.'", "The man, who was a peaceable quiet sort of fellow, made no objections, but simply said: 'Good, let us do so.'", "The daughter, however, had overheard their talk, and she ran to the flock and lamented aloud: 'Oh, dear little mother, they are going to slaughter you!'", "'Well, then, if they do slaughter me,' was the black sheep's answer, 'eat you neither the meat nor the broth that is made of me, but gather all my bones, and bury them by the edge of the field.'", "Shortly after this they

led her into the hall, where she was highly honoured; but the witch's daughter sucked the bones under the table, and crouching at the people's feet she got an eye knocked out, poor thing!", "Now no one knew any more than before about the good man's daughter, no one knew whence she came; but the Prince had had the threshold smeared with tar, and as she fled her gold slippers stuck to it.", "She reached the birch tree, and laying aside her finery, she said: 'Alas!", "dear little mother, I have lost my gold slippers!'", "'Let them be,' was her mother's reply; 'if you need them I shall give you finer ones.'", "Scarcely was she in her usual place behind the stove when her father came home with the witch.", "Immediately the witch began to mock her, saying: 'Ah! you poor thing, there is nothing

last; 'go and fetch her, and let her try on the things.'", "So the girl was fetched, and the Prince was just going to hand the ornaments to her, when the witch held him back, saying: 'Don't give them to her; she soils everything with cinders; give them to my daughter rather.'", "Well, then the Prince gave the witch's daughter the ring, and the woman filed and pared away at her daughter's finger till the ring fitted.", "It was the same with the circlet and the shoes of gold.", "The witch would not allow them to be handed to the cinder wench; she worked at her own daughter's head and feet till

he stood in the yard: 'Alas!", "dear Prince, do not rob me of my silver and my gold.'", "Thereupon the King's son recognised the cinder wench; so he took both the girls with him, and set out.", "After they had gone some little way they came to the bank of a river, and the Prince threw the witch's daughter across to serve as a bridge, and so got over with the cinder wench.", "There lay the witch's daughter then, like a bridge over the river, and could not stir, though her heart was consumed with grief.", "No help was near, so she cried at last in her anguish: 'May there grow a golden hemlock out of my body!", "perhaps my mother will know me by that token.'", "Scarcely had she spoken when a golden hemlock sprang up from her, and stood upon the bridge.", "Now, as soon as the Prince had got rid of the witch's daughter he greeted the cinder wench as his bride, and they wandered together to the birch tree which grew upon the mother's grave.", "There they received all sorts of treasures and riches, three sacks full of gold, and as much silver, and a splendid steed, which bore them home to the palace.", "There they lived a long time together, and the young wife bore a son to the Prince.",

had better away with my gift for the infant, then.'", "And so saying she set out.", "Thus it happened that she came to the bank of the river, and there she saw the beautiful golden hemlock growing in

but that, he saw, must have been very long ago.", "The sheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it, but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the fa\u00e7ade.", "All were securely locked, so he began a circuit of the Cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening.", "Even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on automatically.", "A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture.", "Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly litten by the western sun's filtered rays.", "Debris, old barrels, and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye, though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines.", "The rusted remains of a hot-air furnace showed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late as mid-Victorian times.", "Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strewn concrete floor.", "The vaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions; and in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs.", "He felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectral building, but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about\u2014finding a still-intact barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit.", "Then, bracing himself, he crossed the wide, cobweb-festooned space toward the arch.", "Half-choked with the omnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres, he reached and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness.", "He had no light, but groped carefully with his hands.", "After a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead, and a little fumbling revealed its ancient latch.", "It opened inward, and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined corridor lined with worm-eaten panelling.", "Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion.", "All the inner doors were unlocked, so that he freely passed from room to room.", "The colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dust over box pews, altar, hour-glass pulpit, and sounding-board and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered Gothic columns.", "Over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange, half-blackened panes of the great apsidal windows.", "The paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake could scarcely decipher what they had represented, but from the little he could make out he did not like them.", "The designs were largely conventional, and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much concerning some of the ancient patterns.", "The few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly open to criticism, while one of the windows seemed to show merely a dark space with spirals of curious luminosity scattered about in it.", "Turning away from the windows, Blake noticed that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind, but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy Egypt.", "In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and ceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books.", "Here for the first time he received a positive shock of objective horror, for the titles of those books told him much.", "They were the black, forbidden things which most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard of only in furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secret and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man's youth, and the dim, fabulous days before man was.", "He had himself read many of them\u2014a Latin version of the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamous Cultes des Goules of Comte d'Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn's hellish De Vermis Mysteriis.", "But there were others he had known merely by reputation or not at all\u2014the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume of wholly unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognizable to the occult student.", "Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied.", "This place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe.", "In the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with entries in some odd cryptographic medium.", "The manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy, astrology, and other dubious arts\u2014the devices of the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiacal signs\u2014here massed in solid pages of text, with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter.", "In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in his coat pocket.", "Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably, and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time.", "He wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long.", "Was he the first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place from visitors?", "Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple\u2014objects so long familiar to him at a distance.", "The ascent was a choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders had done their worst in this constricted place.", "The staircase was a spiral with high, narrow wooden treads, and now and then Blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the city.", "Though he had seen no ropes below, he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower whose narrow, louvre-boarded lancet windows his field-glass had studied so often.", "Here he was doomed to disappointment; for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and clearly devoted to vastly different purposes.", "The room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet windows, one on each side, which were glazed within their screening of decayed louvre-boards.", "These had been further fitted with tight, opaque screens, but the latter were now largely rotted away.", "In the centre of the dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs.", "On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form; its hinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding what looked beneath the decade-deep dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through.", "Around the pillar in a rough circle were seven high-backed Gothic chairs still largely intact, while behind them, ranging along the dark-panelled walls, were seven colossal images of crumbling, black-painted plaster, resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious Easter Island.", "In one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall, leading up to the closed trap door of the windowless steeple above.", "As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on the strange open box of yellowish metal.", "Approaching, he tried to clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting entities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this planet.", "The four-inch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter.", "It did not touch the bottom of the box, but was held suspended by means of a metal band around its centre, with seven queerly-designed supports extending horizontally to angles of the box's inner wall near the top.", "This stone, once exposed, exerted upon Blake an almost alarming fascination.", "He could scarcely tear his eyes from it, and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent, with half-formed worlds of wonder within.", "Into his mind floated pictures of alien orbs with great stone towers, and other orbs with titan mountains and no mark of life, and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and will.", "When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple.", "Just why it took his attention he could not tell, but something in its contours carried a message to his unconscious mind.", "Ploughing toward it, and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs as he went, he began to discern something grim about it.", "Hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth, and Blake gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions.", "It was a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time.", "The clothing was in shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man's grey suit.", "There were other bits of evidence\u2014shoes, metal clasps, huge buttons for round cuffs, a stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter's badge with the name of the old Providence Telegram, and a crumbling leather pocketbook.", "Blake examined the latter with care, finding within it several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893, some cards with the name \"Edwin M. Lillibridge\", and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda.", "This paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully at the dim westward window.", "Its disjointed text included such phrases as the following:", "-- Prof. Enoch Bowen home from Egypt May 1844\u2014buys old Free-Will Church in July\u2014his archaeological work & studies in occult well known.", "Dr. Drowne of 4th Baptist warns against Starry Wisdom in sermon 29 Dec. 1844.", "Congregation 97 by end of '45.", "1846\u20143 disappearances\u2014first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.", "7 disappearances 1848\u2014stories of blood sacrifice begin.", "Investigation 1853 comes to nothing\u2014stories of sounds.", "Fr.

deserted edifice forty-two years before in quest of a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold enough to attempt.", "Perhaps no one else had known of his plan\u2014who could tell?", "But he had never returned to his paper.", "Had some bravely-suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden heart-failure?", "Blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state.", "Some of them were badly scattered, and a few seemed oddly dissolved at the ends.", "Others were strangely yellowed, with vague suggestions of charring.", "This charring extended to some of the fragments of clothing.", "The skull was in a very peculiar state\u2014stained yellow, and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone.", "What had happened to the skeleton during its four decades of silent entombment here Blake could not imagine.", "Before he realized it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind.", "He saw processions of robed, hooded figures whose outlines were not human, and looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching monoliths.", "He saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea, and vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze.", "And beyond all else he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semisolid forms were known only by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed to superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana of the worlds we know.", "Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing, indeterminate panic fear.", "Blake choked and turned away from the stone, conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness.", "He felt entangled with something\u2014something which was not in the stone, but which had looked through it at him\u2014something which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not physical sight.", "Plainly, the place was getting on his nerves\u2014as well it might in view of his gruesome find.", "The light was waning, too, and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would have to be leaving soon.", "It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone.", "He had tried to look away from it, but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes back.", "Was there a subtle phosphorescence of radio-activity about the thing?", "What was it that the dead man's notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron?", "What, anyway, was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil?", "What had been done here, and what might still be lurking in the bird-shunned shadows?", "It seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisen somewhere close by, though its source was not apparent.", "Blake seized the cover of the long-open box and snapped it down.", "It moved easily on its alien hinges, and closed completely over the unmistakably glowing stone.", "At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the steeple's eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door.", "Rats, without question\u2014the only living things to reveal their presence in this accursed pile since he had entered it.", "And yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted basement, out amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square, and down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of Federal Hill towards the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks of the college district.", "During the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition.", "Instead, he read much in certain books, examined long years of newspaper files downtown, and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room.", "The cipher, he soon saw, was no simple one; and after a long period of endeavour he felt sure that its language could not be English, Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, or German.", "Evidently he would have to draw upon the deepest wells of his strange erudition.", "Every evening the old impulse to gaze westwards returned, and he saw the black steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and half-fabulous world.", "But now it held a fresh note of terror for him.", "He knew the heritage of evil lore it masked, and with the knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways.", "The birds of spring were returning, and as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they avoided the gaunt, lone spire as never before.", "When a flock of them approached it, he thought, they would wheel and scatter in panic confusion\u2014and he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the intervening miles.", "It was in June that Blake's diary told of his victory over the cryptogram.", "The text was, he found, in the dark Aklo language used by certain cults of evil antiquity, and known to him in a halting way through previous researches.", "The diary is strangely reticent about what Blake deciphered, but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his results.", "There are references to a Haunter of the Dark awaked by gazing into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures about the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called.", "The being is spoken of as holding all knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices.", "Some of Blake's entries show fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalk abroad; though he adds that the streetlights form a bulwark which cannot be crossed.", "Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth.", "It was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings.", "It crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from nighted Khem.", "The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records.", "Then it slept in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till the delver's spade once more brought it forth to curse mankind.", "Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake's entries, though in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to their contribution.", "It appears that a new fear had been growing on Federal Hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded church.", "The Italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark windowless steeple, and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams.", "Something, they said, was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark enough to venture forth.", "Press items mentioned the longstanding local superstitions, but failed to shed much light on the earlier background of the horror.", "It was obvious that the young reporters of today are no antiquarians.", "In writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire.", "At the same time, however, he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits a morbid longing\u2014pervading even his dreams\u2014to visit the accursed tower and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone.", "Then something in the Journal on the morning of 17 July threw the diarist into a veritable fever of horror.", "It was only a variant of the other half-humorous items about the Federal hill restlessness, but to Blake it was somehow very terrible indeed.", "In the night a thunderstorm had put the city's lighting-system out of commission for a full hour, and in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with fright.", "Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps' absence and gone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, altogether dreadful way.", "Towards the last it had bumped up to the tower, where there were sounds of the shattering of glass.", "It could go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it fleeing.", "When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the tower, for even the feeble light trickling through the grime-blackened, louvre-boarded windows was too much for the thing.", "It had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in time\u2014for a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had called it.", "During the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas\u2014a guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness.", "Once, those nearest the church declared, the outer door had rattled hideously.", "But even this was not the worst.", "That evening in the Bulletin Blake read of what the reporters had found.", "Aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the scare, a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of Italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after trying the doors in vain.", "They found the dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way, with bits of rotted cushions and satin pew-linings scattered curiously around.", "There was a bad odour everywhere, and here and there were bits of yellow stain and patches of what looked like charring.", "Opening the door to the tower, and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above, they found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean.", "In the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed.", "They spoke of the heptagonal stone pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs, and the bizarre plaster images; though strangely enough the metal box and the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned.", "What disturbed Blake the most\u2014except for the hints of stains and charring and bad odours\u2014was the final detail that explained the crashing glass.", "Every one of the tower's lancet windows was broken, and two of them had been darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin pew-linings and cushion-horsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior louvre-boards.", "More satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered around the newly swept floor, as if someone had been interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness of its tightly curtained days.", "Yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the windowless spire, but when a reporter climbed up, opened the horizontally-sliding trap-door and shot a feeble flashlight beam into the black and strangely foetid space, he saw nothing but darkness, and a heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture.", "The verdict, of course, was charlatanry.", "Somebody had played a joke on the superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good.", "Or perhaps some of the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax on the outside world.", "There was an amusing aftermath when the police sent an officer to verify the reports.", "Three men in succession found ways of evading the assignment, and the fourth went very reluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given by the reporters.", "From this point onwards Blake's diary shows a mounting tide of insidious horror and nervous apprehension.", "He upbraids himself for not doing something, and speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown.", "It had been verified that on three occasions\u2014during thunderstorms\u2014he telephoned the electric light company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken.", "Now and then his entries show concern over the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and the strangely marred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower room.", "He assumed that these things had been removed\u2014whither, and by whom or what, he could only guess.", "But his worst fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeple\u2014that monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black spaces.", "He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will, and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and stare out of the west window at that far-off spire-bristling mound beyond the swirling smoke of the city.", "His entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams, and of a strengthening of the unholy rapport in his sleep.", "There is mention of a night when he awakened to find himself fully dressed, outdoors, and headed automatically down College Hill towards the west.", "Again and again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him.", "The week following 30 July is recalled as the time of Blake's partial breakdown.", "He did not dress, and ordered all his food by telephone.", "Visitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed, and he said that sleep-walking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untying.", "In his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the collapse.", "After retiring on the night of the 30th, he had suddenly found himself groping about in an almost black space.", "All he could see were short, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he could smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive sounds above him.", "Whenever he moved he stumbled over something, and at each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from above\u2014a vague stirring, mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood.", "Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top, whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall, and fumbling his uncertain way upwards towards some region of intenser stench where a hot, searing blast beat down against him.", "Before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played, all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness.", "He thought of the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute held in nameless paws.", "Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused him to the unutterable horror of his position.", "What it was, he never knew\u2014perhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their various patron saints, or the saints of their native villages in Italy.", "In any event he shrieked aloud, dropped frantically from the ladder, and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber that encompassed him.", "He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral staircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn.", "There was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow, a sightless scramble through a littered basement, a climb to regions of air and street lights outside, and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black towers, and up the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door.", "On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study floor fully dressed.", "Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch of his body seemed sore and bruised.", "When he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing.", "It was then that his nerves broke down.", "Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little but stare from his west window, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary.", "The great storm broke just before midnight on 8 August.", "Lightning struck repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were reported.", "The rain was torrential, while a constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands.", "Blake was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system, and tried to telephone the company around 1 A.M. though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interests of safety.", "He recorded everything in his diary\u2014the large, nervous, and often undecipherable, hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair, and of entries scrawled blindly in the dark.", "He had to keep the house dark in order to see out of the window, and it appears that most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distant lights marking Federal Hill.", "Now and then he would fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases such as \"The lights must not go\"; \"It knows where I am\"; \"I must destroy it\"; and \"it is calling to me, but perhaps it means no injury this time\"; are found scattered down two of the pages.", "Then the lights went out all over the city.", "It happened at 2.12 A.M. according to power-house records, but Blake's diary gives no indication of the time.", "The entry is merely, \"Lights out\u2014God help me.\"", "On Federal Hill there were watchers as anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oil lanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern Italy.", "They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical signs of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether.", "A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew threateningly dark.", "Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church, and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could.", "Of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower, there could be no doubt whatever.", "For what happened at 2.35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young, intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monohan of the Central Station, an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of the seventy-eight men who had gathered around the church's high bank wall\u2014especially those in the square where the eastward fa\u00e7ade was visible.", "Of course there was nothing which can be proved as being outside the order of Nature.", "The possible causes of such an event are many.", "No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in a vast, ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted building of heterogeneous contents.", "Mephitic vapours\u2014spontaneous combustion\u2014pressure of gases born of long decay\u2014any one of numberless phenomena might be responsible.", "And then, of course, the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded.", "The thing was really quite simple in itself, and covered less than three minutes of actual time.", "Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked at his watch repeatedly.", "It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the black tower.", "There had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange, evil odours from the church, and this had now become emphatic and offensive.", "Then at last there was a sound of splintering wood and a large, heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly fa\u00e7ade.", "The tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn, but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was the smoke-grimed louvre-boarding of that tower's east window.", "Immediately afterwards an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseen heights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and almost prostrating those in the square.", "At the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden east-blowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas from the crowd.", "Nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night, though some upward-looking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky sky\u2014something like a formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed towards the east.", "That was all.", "The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and discomfort, and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at all.", "Not knowing what had happened, they did not relax their vigil; and a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning, followed by an earsplitting crash of sound, rent the flooded heavens.", "Half an hour later the rain stopped, and in fifteen minutes more the street lights sprang on again, sending the weary, bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes.", "The next day's papers gave these matters minor mention in connection with the general storm reports.", "It seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east, where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise noticed.", "The phenomenon was most marked over College Hill, where the crash awakened all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of speculations.", "Of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill, or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens.", "It was agreed that the lone, sudden lightning-bolt must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood, though no trace of its striking could afterwards be found.", "A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but his observation has not been verified.", "All of the few observers, however, agree as to the violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke, whilst evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is equally general.", "These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connection with the death of Robert Blake.", "Students in the Psi Delta house, whose upper rear windows looked into Blake's study, noticed the blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the ninth, and wondered what was wrong with the expression.", "When they saw the same face in the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched for the lights to come up in his apartment.", "Later they rang the bell of the darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the door.", "The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive fright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened dismay.", "Shortly afterwards the coroner's physician made an examination, and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous tension induced by electrical discharge, as the cause of death.", "The hideous expression he ignored altogether, deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions.", "He deduced these latter qualities from the books, paintings, and manuscripts found in the apartment, and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk.", "Blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last, and the broken-pointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand.", "The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and legible only in part.", "From them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict, but such speculations have little chance for belief among the conservative.", "The case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action of superstitious Doctor Dexter, who threw the curious box and angled stone\u2014an object certainly self-luminous as seen in the black windowless steeple where it was found\u2014into the deepest channel of Narragansett Bay.", "Excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on Blake's part, aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he had uncovered, form the dominant interpretation given those final frenzied jottings.", "These are the entries\u2014or all that can be made of them:", "-- Lights still out\u2014must be five minutes now.

\"if no traders deal there, the mate will never come.", "And as for Kalamake, it is not possible he can ever get as far as this.\"", "With that he kept edging the schooner nearer in.", "He had to do this quietly, for it was the trouble with these white men, and above all with the mate, that you could never be sure of them; they would all be sleeping sound, or else pretending, and if a sail shook, they would jump to their feet and fall on you with a rope's end.", "So Keola edged her up little by little, and kept all drawing.", "And presently the land was close on board, and the sound of the sea on the sides of it grew loud.", "With that, the mate sat up suddenly upon the house.", "\"What are you doing?\" he roars.", "\"You'll have the ship ashore!\"", "And he made one bound for Keola, and Keola made another clean over the rail and plump into the starry sea.", "When he came up again, the schooner had payed off on her true course, and the mate stood by the wheel himself, and Keola heard him cursing.", "The sea was smooth under the lee of the island; it was warm besides, and Keola had his sailor's knife, so he had no fear of sharks.", "A little way before him the trees stopped; there was a break in the line of the land like the mouth of a harbor; and the tide, which was then flowing, took him up and carried him through.", "One minute he was without, and the next within, had floated there in a wide shallow water, bright with ten thousand stars, and all about him was the ring of the land, with its string of palm-trees.", "And he was amazed, because this was a kind of island he had never heard of.", "The time of Keola in that place was in two periods\u2014the period when he was alone, and the period when he was there with the tribe.", "At first he sought everywhere and found no man; only some houses standing in a hamlet, and the marks of fires.", "But the ashes of the fires were cold and the rains had washed them away; and the winds had blown, and some of the huts were overthrown.", "It was here he took his dwelling; and he made a fire drill, and a shell hook, and fished and cooked his fish, and climbed after green cocoanuts, the juice of which he drank, for in all the isle there was no water.", "The days were long to him, and the nights terrifying.", "He made a lamp of cocoa-shell, and drew the oil of the ripe nuts, and made a wick of fibre; and when evening came he closed up his hut, and lit his lamp, and lay and trembled till morning.", "Many a time he thought in his heart he would have been better in the bottom of the sea, his bones rolling there with the others.", "All this while he kept by the inside of the island, for the huts were on the shore of the lagoon, and it was there the palms grew best, and the lagoon itself abounded with good fish.", "And to the outer side he went once only, and he looked but once at the beach of the ocean, and came away shaking.", "For the look of it, with its bright sand, and strewn shells, and strong sun and surf, went sore against his inclination.", "\"It cannot be,\" he thought, \"and yet it is very like.", "And how do I know?", "These white men, although they pretend to know where they are sailing, must take their chance like other people.", "So that after all we may have sailed in a circle, and I may be quite near to Molokai, and this may be the very beach where my father-in-law gathers his dollars.\"", "So after that he was prudent, and kept to the land side.", "It was perhaps a month later, when the people of the place arrived\u2014the fill of six great boats.", "They were a fine race of men, and spoke a tongue that sounded very different from the tongue of Hawaii, but so many of the words were the same that it was not difficult to understand.", "The men besides were very courteous, and the women very towardly; and they made Keola welcome, and built him a house, and gave him a wife; and what surprised him the most, he was never sent to work with the young men.", "And now Keola had three periods.", "First he had a period of being very sad, and then he had a period when he was pretty merry.", "Last of all came the third, when he was the most terrified man in the four oceans.", "The cause of the first period was the girl he had to wife.", "He was in doubt about the island, and he might have been in doubt about the speech, of which he had heard so little when he came there with the wizard on the mat.", "But about his wife there was no mistake conceivable, for she was the same girl that ran from him crying in the wood.", "So he had sailed all this way, and might as well have stayed in Molokai; and had left home and wife and all his friends for no other cause but to escape his enemy, and the place he had come to was that wizard's hunting ground, and the place where he walked invisible.", "It was at this period when he kept the most close to the lagoon side, and as far as he dared, abode in the cover of his hut.", "The cause of the second period was talk he heard from his wife and the chief islanders.", "Keola himself said little.", "He was never so sure of his new friends, for he judged they were too civil to be wholesome, and since he had grown better acquainted with his father-in-law the man had grown more cautious.", "So he told them nothing of himself, but only his name and descent, and that he came from the Eight Islands, and what fine islands they were; and about the king's palace in Honolulu, and how he was a chief friend of the king and the missionaries.", "But he put many questions and learned much.", "The island where he was was called the Isle of Voices; it belonged to the tribe, but they made their home upon another, three hour's sail to the southward.", "There they lived and had their permanent houses, and it was a rich island, where were eggs and chickens and pigs, and ships came trading with rum and tobacco.", "It was there the schooner had gone after Keola deserted; there, too, the mate had died, like the fool of a white man as he was.", "It seems, when the ship came, it was the beginning of the sickly season in that isle, when the fish of the lagoon are poisonous, and all who eat of them swell up and die.", "The mate was told of it; he saw the boats preparing, because in that season the people leave that island and sail to the Isle of Voices; but he was a fool of a white man, who would believe no stories but his own, and he caught one of these fish, cooked it and ate it, and swelled up and died, which was good news to Keola.", "As for the Isle of Voices, it lay solitary the most part of the year; only now and then a boat's crew came for copra, and in the bad season, when the fish at the main isle were poisonous, the tribe dwelt there in a body.", "It had its name from a marvel, for it seemed the seaside of it was all beset with invisible devils; day and night you heard them talking one with another in strange tongues; day and night little fires blazed up and were extinguished on the beach; and what was the cause of these doings no man might conceive.", "Keola asked them if it were the same in their own island where they stayed, and they told him no, not there; nor yet in any other of some hundred isles that lay all about them in that sea; but it was a thing peculiar to the Isle of Voices.", "They told him also that these fires and voices were ever on the seaside and in the seaward fringes of the wood, and a man might dwell by the lagoon two thousand years (if he could live so long) and never be any way troubled; and even on the seaside the devils did no harm if let alone.", "Only once a chief had cast a spear at one of the voices, and the same night he fell out of a cocoanut-palm and was killed.", "Keola thought a good bit with himself.", "He saw he would be all right when the tribe returned to the main island, and right enough where he was, if he kept by the lagoon, yet he had a mind to make things righter if he could.", "So he told the high chief he had once been in an isle that was pestered the same way, and the folk had found a means to cure that trouble.", "\"There was a tree growing in the bush there,\" says he, \"and it seems these devils came to get the leaves of it.", "So the people of the isle cut down the tree wherever it was found, and the devils came no more.\"", "They asked what kind of a tree this was, and he showed them the tree of which Kalamake burned the leaves.", "They found it hard to believe, yet the idea tickled them.", "Night after night the old men debated it in their councils, but the high chief (though he was a brave man) was afraid of the matter, and reminded them daily of the chief who cast a spear against the voices and was killed, and the thought of that brought all to a stand again.", "Though he could not yet bring about the destruction of the trees, Keola was well enough pleased, and began to look about him and take pleasure in his days; and, among other things, he was the kinder to his wife, so that the girl began to love him greatly.", "One day he came to the hut, and she lay on the ground lamenting.", "\"Why,\" said Keola, \"what is wrong with you now?\"", "She declared it was nothing.", "The same night she woke him.", "The lamp burned very low, but he saw by her face she was in sorrow.", "\"Keola,\" she said, \"put your ear to my mouth that I may whisper, for no one must hear us.", "Two days before the boats begin to be got ready, go you to the sea-side of the isle and lie in a thicket.", "We shall choose that place beforehand, you and I; and hide food; and every night I shall come near by there singing.", "So when a night comes and you do not hear me, you shall know we are clean gone out of the island, and you may come forth again in safety.\"", "The soul of Keola died within him.", "\"What is this?\" he cried.", "\"I cannot live among devils.", "I will not be left behind upon this isle.", "I am dying to leave it.\"", "\"You will never leave it alive, my poor Keola,\" said the girl; \"for to tell you the truth, my people are eaters of men; but", "this they keep secret.", "And the reason they will kill you before we leave is because in our island ships come, and Donat-Kimaran comes and talks for the French, and there is a white trader there in a house with a veranda, and a catechist.", "Oh, that is a fine place indeed!", "The trader has barrels filled with flour; and a French warship once came in the lagoon and gave everybody wine and biscuit.", "Ah, my poor Keola, I wish I could take you there, for great is my love to you, and it is the finest place in the seas except Papeete.\"", "So now Keola was the most terrified man in the four oceans.", "He had heard tell of eaters of men in the south islands, and the thing had always been a fear to him; and here it was knocking at his door.", "He had heard besides, by travellers, of their practices, and how when they are in a mind to eat a man, they cherish and fondle him like a mother with a favorite baby.", "And he saw this must be his own case; and that was why he had been housed, and fed, and wived, and liberated from all work; and why the old men and the chiefs discoursed with him like a person of weight.", "So he lay on his bed and railed upon his destiny; and the flesh curdled on his bones.", "The next day the people of the tribe were very civil, as their way was.", "They were elegant speakers, and they made beautiful poetry, and jested at meals, so that a missionary must have died laughing.", "It was little enough Keola cared for their fine ways; all he saw was the white teeth shining in their mouths, and his gorge rose at the sight; and when they were done eating, he went and lay in the bush like a dead man.", "The next day it was the same, and then his wife followed him.", "\"Keola,\" she said, \"if you do not eat, I tell you plainly you will be killed and cooked tomorrow.", "Some of the old chiefs are murmuring already.", "They think you are fallen sick and must lose flesh.\"", "With that Keola got to his feet, and anger burned in him.", "\"It is little I care one way or the other,\" said he.", "\"I am between the devil and the deep sea.", "Since die I must, let me die the quickest way; and since I must be eaten at the best of it, let me rather be eaten by hobgoblins than by men.", "Farewell,\" said he, and he left her standing, and walked to the sea-side of that island.", "It was all bare in the strong sun; there was no sign of man, only the beach was trodden, and all about him as he went, the voices talked and whispered, and the little fires sprang up and burned down.", "All tongues of the earth were spoken there: the French, the Dutch, the Russian, the Tamil, the Chinese.", "Whatever land knew sorcery, there were some of its people whispering in Keola's ear.", "That beach was thick as a cried fair, yet no man seen; and as he walked he saw the shells vanish before him, and no man to pick them up.", "I think the devil would have been afraid to be alone in such a company; but Keola was past fear and courted death.", "When the fires sprang up, he charged for them like a bull.", "Bodiless voices called to and fro; unseen hands poured sand upon the flames; and they were gone from the beach before he reached them.", "\"It is plain Kalamake is not here,\" he thought, \"as I must have been killed long since.\"", "\"With that he sat him down in the margin of the wood, for he was tired, and put his chin upon his hands.", "The business before his eyes continued; the beach babbled with voices, and the fires sprang up and sank, and the shells vanished and were renewed again even while he looked.", "\"It was a by-day when I was here before,\" he thought, \"for it was nothing to this.\"", "And his head was dizzy with the thought of these millions and millions of dollars, and all these hundreds and hundreds of persons culling them upon the beach and flying in the air higher and swifter than eagles.", "\"And to think how they have fooled me with their talk of mints,\" says he, \"and that money was made there, when it is clear that all the new coin in all the world is gathered on these sands!", "But I will know better the next time!\" said he.", "And at last, he knew not very well how or when, sleep fell on Keola, and he forgot the island and all his sorrows.", "Early the next day, before the sun was yet up, a bustle woke him.", "He awoke in fear, for he thought the tribe had caught him napping; but it was no such matter.", "Only, on the beach in front of him, the bodiless voices called and shouted one upon another, and it seemed they all passed and swept beside him up the coast of the island.", "\"What is afoot now?\" thinks Keola.", "And it was plain to him it was something beyond ordinary, for the fires were not lighted nor the shells taken, but the bodiless voices kept posting up the beach, and hailing and dying away; and others following, and by the sound of them these wizards should be angry.", "\"It is not me they are angry at,\" thought Keola, \"for they pass me close.\"", "As when hounds go by, or horses in a race, or city folk coursing to a fire, and all men join and follow after, so it was now with Keola; and he knew not what he did, nor why he did it, but there, lo and behold I he was running with the voices.", "So he turned one point of the island, and this brought him in view of a second; and there he remembered the wizard trees to have been growing by the score together in a wood.", "From this point there went up a hubbub of men crying not to be described; and by the sound of them, those that he ran with shaped their course for the same quarter.", "A little nearer, and there began to mingle with the outcry the crash of many axes.", "And at this a thought came at last into his mind that the high chief had consented;

with ideas against which there was no appeal; hard rather than firm, at times he could even be jocular,\u2014doubtless a good father, a good husband, really not vicious, but , bad.", "He was one of those men who never can grasp a fresh idea, who apparently fail to be moved by an emotion;

but a spark from a like source is apt to end in a conflagration.", "The inspector soon singled out Claude Gueux, who had been numbered and placed in the workshop, and finding him clever, treated him well.", "Seeing Claude looking sad (for he was ever thinking of her he termed his wife), and being in a good humour, by way of pastime to console the prisoner he told him the woman had become one of the unfortunate sisterhood, and had been reduced to infamy; of the child nothing was known.", "After a time Claude had accustomed himself to prison rule, and by his calmness of manner and a certain amount of resolution clearly marked in his face, he had acquired a great ascendancy over his companions, who so much admired him that they asked his advice, and tried in all ways to imitate him.", "The very expression in his eyes clearly indicated the man's character; besides, is not the eye the window to the soul, and what other result could be anticipated than that the intelligent spirit should lead men with few ideas, who yielded to the attraction as the metal does to the loadstone?", "In less than three months Claude was the virtual head of the workshop, and at times he almost doubted whether he was king or prisoner, being treated something like a captive pope, surrounded by his cardinals.", "Such popularity ever has as its attendant hatred;

but had he only observed Claude he would have seen the evident change, noticable to all present, and he would have heard these words, spoken respectfully but firmly:\u2014- \"Sir, listen to me; send my companion to me.", "It would be wise to do so, I can assure you.", "Remember my words!\"", "On Sunday he had sat for hours in the courtyard, with his head bowed in his hands, and when a prisoner called Faillette came up laughing, Claude said, \"I am judging some one.\"", "On the 25th of October, 1831, as the inspector went his rounds, Claude, to draw his attention, smashed a watch-glass he had found in the passage.", "This had the desired effect.", "\"It was I,\" said Claude.", "\"Sir, resore my comrade to me.\"", "\"Impossible,\" was the answer.", "Looking the inspector full in the face, Claude firmly added: \"Now, reflect!", "Today is the 25th of October;

was equally popular here as elsewhere.", "\"Can any one lend me an axe?\" he said.", "\"What for?\"", "Without exacting any promises of secrecy he at once replied: \"To kill the inspector with tonight.\"", "Claude was at once offered several; choosing the smallest, he hid it beneath his waistcoat and left.", "Now, there were twenty-seven prisoners present, and not one of those men betrayed him; they even refrained from talking upon the subject among themselves, waiting for the terrible event which must follow.", "As Claude passed on he saw a young convict of sixteen yawning idly there, and he strongly advised him to learn how to read.", "Just then Faillette asked what he was hiding.", "Claude answered unhestitatingly: \"An axe to kill Monsieur D____ tonight; but can you see it?\"", "\"A little,\" said Faillette.", "At seven o'clock the prisoners were locked in their several workshops.", "It was then the custom for the warders to leave them, until the inspector has been his rounds.", "In Claude's workshop a most extraordinary scene took place, the only one of its kind on record.", "Claude rose and addressed his companions, eighty-four in number, in the following words:\u2014 \"You all know Albin and I were like brothers.", "I liked him at first for sharing his rations with me, afterwards because he cared for me.", "Now I never have sufficient, though I spend the pittance I earn in bread.", "It could make no possible difference to the inspector, Monsieur D____, that we should be together; but he chose to separate us simply from a love of tormenting, for he is a bad man.", "I asked again and again for Albin to be sent back, without success; and when I gave him a stated time, the 4th of November, I was thrust into a dungeon.", "During that time I became his judge, and sentenced him to death on November the 4th.", "In two hours he will be here, and I warn you I intend to kill him.", "But have you anything to say?\"", "There was dead silence.", "Claude then continued telling his comrades, the eighty-one thieves, his ideas on the subject,\u2014that he was reduced to a fearful extremity, and compelled by that very necessity to take the law into his own hands; that he knew full well he could not take the inspector's life without sacrificing his own, but that as the cause was a just one he would bear the consequences, having come to the conclusion after two months' calm reflection; that if they considered resentment alone hurried him on to such a step they were at once to say so, and to state their objections to the sentence being carried out.", "One voice alone broke the silence which followed, saying, \"Before killing the inspector, Claude ought to give him a chance of relenting.\"", "\"That is but just,\" said Claude, \"and he shall have the benefit of the doubt.\"", "Claude then sorted the few things a poor prisoner is allowed, and gave them to the comrades he mostly cared for after Albin, keeping only the pair of scissors.", "He then embraced them all,\u2014some not being able to withold their tears at such a moment.", "Claude continued calmly to converse during this last hour, and even gave way to a trick he had as a boy, of extinguishing the candle with a breath from his nose.", "Seeing him thus, his companions afterwards owned that they hoped he had abandoned his sinister idea.", "One young convict looked at him fixedly, trembling for the coming event.", "\"Take courage, young fellow,\" said Claude, gently; \"it will be but the work of a minute.\"", "The workshop was a long room with a door at both ends, and with windows each side overlooking the benches, thus leaving a pathway up the centre for the inspector to review the work on both sides of him.", "Claude had now resumed his work, \u2014 something like Jacques Clement, who did not fail to repeat his prayers.", "As the clock sounded the last quarter to nine, Claude rose and placed himself near the entrance, apparently calm.", "Amidst the most profound silence the clock struck nine; the door was thrown open, and the inspector came in as usual alone, looking quite jovial and self-satisfied, passing rapidly along, tossing his head at one, grinding words out to another, little heeding the eyes fixed so fiercely upon him.", "Just then he heard Claude's step, and turning quickly round said, \u2014 \"What are you doing here?", "Why are you not in your place?\" just as he would have spoken to a dog.", "Claude answered respectfully, \"I wish to speak to you, sir.\"", "\"On what subject?\" \"Albin.\"", "\"Again!\"", "\"Always the same,\" said Claude.", "\"So then,\" replied the inspector, walking along, \"you have not had enough with twenty-four hours in the blackhole.\"", "Claude, following him closely, replied: \"Sir, return my companion to me!\"", "\"Impossible!\"", "\"Sir,\" continued Claude, in a voice which would have moved Satan, I\" implore you to send Albin back to me; you will then see how I will work.", "You are free, and it would matter but little to you; you do not know the feeling of having only one friend.", "To me it is everything, encircled by the prison walls.", "You can come and go at your pleasure; I have but Albin.", "Pray let him come back to me!", "You know well he shared his food with me.", "What can it matter to you that a man named Claude Gueux should be in this hall, having another by his side called Albin?", "You have but to say 'Yes,' nothing more.", "Sir, my good sir, I implore you, in the name of Heaven, to grant my prayer!\"", "Claude, overcome with emotion, waited for an answer.", "\"Impossible!\" replied the inspector impatiently; \"I will not recall my words.", "Now go, you annoyance!\"", "And with that he hurried on towards the outer door, amidst the breathless silence maintained by eighty-one thieves.", "Claude, following and touching the inspector, gently asked:\" Let me at least know why I am condemned to death.", "Why did you separate us?\"", "\"I have already answered you: because I chose,\" replied the inspector.", "With that he was about to lift the latch, when Claude raised the axe, and without one cry the inspector fell to the ground, with his skull completely cloven from three heavy blows dealt with the rapidity of lightning.", "A fourth completely disfigured his face, and Claude, in his mad fury, gave another and a useless blow ; for the inspector was dead.", "Claude, throwing the axe aside, cried out, \"Now for the other!\"", "The other was himself; and taking the scissors, his wife's, he plunged them into his breast.", "But the blade was short, and the chest was deep, and vainly he strove to give the fatal blow.", "At last, covered with blood he fell fainting across the dead.", "Which of the two would be considered the victim?", "When Claude regained consciousness he was in bed, surrounded by every care and covered with bandages.", "Near him were Sisters of Charity, and a recorder ready to take down his deposition, who with much interest inquired how he was.", "Claude had lost a great deal of blood; but the scissors had done him a bad turn, inflicting wounds not one of which was dangerous: the only mortal blows he had struck were on the body of Monsieur D___.", "Then the interrogatory commenced.", "\"Did you kill the inspector of the prison workshops at Clairvaux?\"", "\"Yes,\" was the reply.", "\"Why did you do so?\"", "\"Because I did.\"", "Claude's wounds now assumed a more serious aspect, and he was prostrated with a fever which threatened his life.", "November, December, January, February passed, in nursing and preparations, and Claude in turn was visited by doctor and judge,\u2014the one to restore him to health, the other to glean the evidence needful to send him to the scaffold.", "On the 16th of March, 1832, perfectly cured, Claude appeared in court at Troyes, to answer the charge brought against him.", "His appearance impressed the court favorably; he had been shaved and stood bareheaded, but still clad in prison garb.", "The court was well guarded by a strong military guard, to keep the witnesses within bounds, as they were all convicts.", "But an unexpected dificulty occurred; not one of these men would give evidence; neither questions nor threats availed to make them break their silence, until Claude requested them to do so.", "Then they in turn gave a faithful account of the terrible event; and if one, from forgetfullness or affection for the accused, failed to relate the whole facts, Claude supplied the deficiency.", "At one time the women's tears fell fast.", "The usher now called the convict Albin.", "He came in trembling with emotion and sobbing painfully, and threw himself into Claude's arms.", "Turning to the Public Prosecutor, Claude said, \u2014 \"Here is a convict who gives his food to the hungry,\" and stooping, he kissed Albin's hand.", "All the witnesses having been examined, the counsel for the prosecution then rose to address the court.", "\"Gentlemen of the jury, society would be utterly put to confusion if a public prosecution did not condemn great culprits like him, who, etc.\"", "After the long address by the prosecution, Claude's counsel rose.", "Then followed the usual pleading for and against, which ever takes place at the criminal court.", "Claude in his turn gave evidence, and every one was astonished at his intelligence; there appeared far more of the orator about this poor workman than the assassin.", "In a clear and straightforward way he detailed the facts as they were, \u2014 standing proudly there, resolved to tell the whole truth.", "At times the crowd was carried away by his eloquence.", "This man, who could not read, would grasp the most difficult points of argument, yet treat the judges with all due deference.", "Once Claude lost his temper, when the counsel for the prosecution stated that he had assassinated the inspector without provocation.", "\"What!\" said Claude, \"I had no provocation?", "Indeed!", "A drunkard strikes me, \u2014 I kill him; then you would allow there was provocation, and the penalty of death would be changed for that of the galleys.", "But a man who wounds me in every way during four years, humiliates me for four years, taunts me daily, hourly, for four years, and heaps every insult on my head,\u2014what follows?", "You consider I have had no provocation!", "I had a wife for whom I robbed,\u2014he tortured me about her.", "I had a child for whom I robbed,\u2014he taunted me about this child.", "I was hungry, a friend shared his bread with me,\u2014he took away my friend.", "I begged him to return my friend to me,\u2014he cast me into a dungeon.", "I told him how much I suffered,\u2014he said it wearied him to listen.", "What then would you have me do?", "I took his life; and you look upon me as a monster for killing this man, and you decapitate me: then do so.\"", "Provocation such as this the law fails to acknowledge, because the blows have no marks to show.", "The judge then summed up the case in a clear and impartial manner,\u2014dwelling on the life Claude had led, living openly with an improper character; then he had robbed, and ended by being a murderer.", "All this was true.", "Before the jury retired, the judge asked Claude if he had any questions to ask, or anything to say.", "\"Very little,\" said Claude. \"", "I am a murderer, I am a thief; but I ask you gentlemen of the jury, why did I kill?", "Why did I steal?\"", "The jury retired for a quarter of an hour, and according to the judgment of these twelve countrymen\u2014gentlemen of the jury, as they are styled\u2014Claude Gueux was condemned to death.", "At the very outset several of them were much impressed with the name of Gueux (vagabond), and that influenced their decision.", "When the verdit was pronounced, Claude simply said: \"Very well; but there are two questions these gentlemen have not answered.", "Why did this man steal?", "What made him a murderer?\"", "He made a good supper that night, exclaiming, \"Thirty-six years have now passed me.\"", "He refused to make any appeal until the last minute, but at the instance of one of the sisters who had nursed him he consented to do so.", "She in her fulness of heart gave him a five-franc piece.", "His fellow prisoners, as we have already noticed, were devoted to him, and placed all the means at their disposal to help him to escape.", "They threw into his dungeon, through the air-hole, a nail, some wire, the handle of a pail: any one of these would have been enough for a man like Claude to free himself from his chains.", "He gave them all up to the warder.", "On the 8th of June, 1832, seven months and four days after the murder, the recorder of the court came, and Claude was told that he had but one hour more to live, for his appeal had been rejected.", "\"Indeed,\" said Claude coldly; \"I slept well last night, and doubtless I shall pass my next even better.\"", "First came the priest, then the executioner.", "he was humble to the priest, and listened to him with great attention, regretting much that he had not had the benefit of religious training, at the same time blaming himself for much in the past.", "He was courteous in his manner to the executioner; in fact he gave up all,\u2014his soul to the priest, his body to the executioner.", "While his hair was being cut, someone mentioned how the cholera was spreading, and Troyes at any moment might become prey to this fearful scourge.", "Claude joined in the conversation, saying, with a smile, \"There is one thing to be said,\u2014I have no fear of the cholera!\"", "He had broken half of the scissors,\u2014what remained he asked the jailer to give to Albin; the other half lay buried in his chest.", "He also wished the day's rations to be taken to his friend.", "The only trifle he retained was the five franc piece that the sister had given him, which he kept in his right hand after he was bound.", "At a quarter to eight, the dismal procession usual in such cases left the prison.", "Pale, but with a firm tread, Claude Gueux slowly mounted the scaffold, keeping his eyes fixed on the crucifix the priest carried,\u2014an emblem of the Savior's suffering.", "He wished to embrace the priest and the executioner, thanking the one and pardoning the other; the executioner simply repulsed him.", "Just before he was bound to the infernal machine, he gave the five franc piece to the priest, saying, \"For the poor.\"", "The hour had scarcely struck its eight chimes, when this man, so noble, so intelligent, received the fatal blow which severed his head from his body.", "A market-day had been chosen for the time of execution, as there would be more people about, for there are still in France small towns that glory in having an execution.", "The guillotine that day remained, inflaming the imagination of the mob to such an extent that one of the tax-gatherers was nearly murdered.", "Such is the admirable effect of public executions!", "We have given the history of Claude Gueux's life, more to solve a difficult problem than for aught else.", "In his life there are two questions to be considered,\u2014before his fall, and after his fall.", "What was his training, and what was the penalty?", "This must interest society generally; for this man was well gifted, his instincts were good.", "Then what was wanting?", "On this revolves the grand problem which would place society on a firm basis.", "What nature has begun in the individual, let society carry out.", "Look at Claude Gueux.", "An intelligent and most noble-hearted man, placed in the midst of evil surroundings, he turned thief.", "Society placed him in a prison where the evil was yet greater, and he ended up becoming a murderer.", "Can we really blame him, or ourselves?\u2014questions which require deep thought, or the result will be that we shall be compelled to shirk

a stranger, or to go on a parade under the command of my grocer, who has been made an officer.", "I wish to cast no reflections on the patrol, who keep order and protect our homes, but on the absurdity of making such parade and military hubub about turning citizens into parodies of soldiers.", "Deputies or ministers!", "it is important that we should sound every subject, even though it end

rather to thank her, for not having given her sore eyes.", "It is the common belief in Naples, that if a person leaves any wish which a pregnant woman expresses ungratified, this disease of the eyes

a joy to look upon, who, from having a fine sprig of parsley on her bosom, was named Petrosinella.", "And the little girl grew from day to day, until when she was seven years old her mother sent her to school; and every time she went along the street and met the ogress, the old woman said to her, \"Tell your mother to remember her promise.\"", "And she went on repeating this message so often, that the poor mother, having no longer patience to listen to the music, said one day to Petrosinella, \"If you meet the old woman as usual, and she reminds you of the hateful promise, answer her, \"Take it!\"", "When Petrosinella, who dreamt of no ill, met the ogress again, and heard her repeat the same words, she answered innocently as her mother had told her; whereupon the ogress, seizing her by her hair, carried her off to a wood, which the horses of the Sun never entered, not having paid the toll to the pastures of those Shades.", "Then she put the poor girl into a tower, which she caused to arise by her art, and which had neither gate nor ladder, but only a little window, through which she ascended and descended by means of Petrosinella's hair, which was very long, as the sailor is used to run up and down the mast of a ship.", "Now it happened one day, when the ogress had left the tower, that Petrosinella put her head out of the little window, and let loose her tresses in the sun; and the son of a prince passing by saw those two golden banners, which invited all souls to enlist under the standard of Love; and beholding with amazement in the midst of those gleaming waves a siren's face, that enchanted all hearts, he fell desperately in love with such wonderful beauty; and sending her a memorial of sighs, she decreed to receive him into favour.", "Matters went on so well with the prince, that there was soon a nodding of heads and a kissing of hands, a winking of eyes and bowing, thanks and offerings, hopes and promises, soft words and compliments.", "And when this had continued for several days, Petrosinella and the prince became so intimate that they made an appointment to meet, and agreed that it should be at night, when the Moon plays at hide-and-seekPassara muta\u2014a Neapolitan game, in which the children follow one another slowly in a line.", "with the Stars; and that Petrosinella should give the ogress some poppy-juice, and draw up the prince with her tresses.", "So when the appointed hour came, the prince went to the tower, where Petrosinella, letting fall her hair at a given signal, he seized it with both his hands, and cried, \"Draw up!\"", "And when he was drawn up, he crept through the little window into the chamber.", "The next morning, before the Sun taught his steeds to leap through the hoop of the Zodiac, the prince descended by the same golden ladder, to go his way home.", "And having repeated these visits many times, a gossip of the ogress, who was for ever prying into things that did not concern her, and poking her nose into every corner, got to find out the secret, and told the ogress to be upon the look-out, for that Petrosinella made love with a certain youth, and she suspected that matters would go further; adding, that she saw what was going on, and feared they would be off and away before May.", "In Naples removals invariably take place in May.", "The ogress thanked her gossip for the information, and said she would take good care to stop up the road; and as to Petrosinella, it was moreover impossible for her to escape, as she had laid a spell upon her, so that, unless she had in her hand the three gallnuts which were in a rafter in the kitchen, it would be labour lost to attempt to get away.", "Whilst they were talking thus together, Petrosinella, who stood with her ears wide open, and had some suspicion of the gossip, overheard all that passed.", "And when Night had spread out her black garments to keep them from the moth, and the prince had come as usual, she made him climb on to the rafters and find the gallnuts, knowing well what effect they would have, as she had been enchanted by the ogress.", "Then, having made a rope-ladder, they both descended to the ground, took to their heels, and scampered off towards the city.", "But the gossip happening to see them come out, set up a loud halloo, and began to shout and make such a noise that the ogress awoke; and seeing that Petrosinella had fled, she descended by the same ladder, which was fastened to the window, and set off running after the lovers, who, when they saw her coming at their heels faster than a horse let loose, gave themselves up for lost.", "But Petrosinella, recollecting the gallnuts, quickly threw one on the ground, and lo!", "instantly a Corsican bulldog   up,\u2014O mother, such a terrible beast!\u2014which with open jaws and barking loud flew at the ogress as if to swallow her at a mouthful.", "But the old woman, who was more cunning and spiteful than the devil, put her hand into her pocket, and pulling out a piece of bread, gave it to the dog, which made him hang his tail and allay his fury.", "Then she turned to run after the fugitives again; but Petrosinella, seeing her approach, threw the second gallnut on the ground, and lo!", "a fierce lion arose, who, lashing the earth with his tail, and shaking his mane, and opening wide his jaws a yard apart, was just preparing to make a slaughter of the ogress; when, turning quickly back, she stripped the skin off an ass that was grazing in the middle of a meadow, and ran at the lion, who, fancying it a real jackass, was so frightened that he bounded away as fast as he could.", "The ogress, having leaped over this second ditch, turned again to pursue the poor lovers, who, hearing the clatter of her heels and seeing the cloud of dust that rose up to the sky, conjectured that she was coming again.", "But the old woman, who was every moment in dread lest the lion should pursue her, had not taken off the ass's skin; and when Petrosinella now threw down the third gallnut, there sprang up a wolf, who, without giving the ogress time to play any new trick, gobbled her up just as she was, in the shape of a jackass.", "So the lovers, being now freed from danger, went their way leisurely and quietly to the kingdom of the prince, where, with his father's free consent, he took Petrosinella to wife; and thus, after all these storms of fate, they experienced the truth, that", "One hour in port, the sailor freed from fears", "Forgets the tempests of a hundred years.\"", "Zeza's story was listened to

cool recesses of the olive grove.", "There he would meditate upon the visions that filled his mind, and there devise the forms of beauty which later became immortal in breathing marble.", "Idle folk, indeed, said that Kalos conversed with the spirits of the grove, and that his statues were but images of the fauns and dryads he met there for he patterned his work after no living model.", "So famous were Kalos and Musides, that none wondered when the Tyrant of Syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of Tyche which he had planned for his city.", "Of great size and cunning workmanship must the statue be, for it was to form a wonder of nations and a goal of travellers.", "Exalted beyond thought would be he whose work should gain acceptance, and for this honor Kalos and Musides were invited to compete.", "Their brotherly love was well known, and the crafty Tyrant surmised that each, instead of concealing his work from the other, would offer aid and advice; this charity producing two images of unheard of beauty, the lovelier of which would eclipse even the dreams of poets.", "With joy the sculptors hailed the Tyrant's offer, so that in the days that followed their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels.", "Not from each other did Kalos and Musides conceal their work, but the sight was for them alone.", "Saving theirs, no eyes beheld the two divine figures released by skillful blows from the rough blocks that had imprisoned them since the world began.", "At night, as of yore, Musides sought the banquet halls of Tegea whilst Kalos wandered alone

great a chance to win art's loftiest reward.", "Many months passed yet in the sour face of Musides came nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arouse.", "Then one day Musides spoke of the illness of Kalos, after which none marvelled again at his sadness, since the sculptors' attachment was known to be deep and sacred.", "Subsequently many went to visit Kalos, and indeed noticed the pallor of his face; but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of Musides who was clearly distracted with anxiety and who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own hands.", "Hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished figures of Tyche, little touched of late by the sick man and his

loved.", "There he would ask to be left alone, as if wishing to speak with unseen things.", "Musides ever granted his requests, though his eyes filled with visible tears at the thought that Kalos should care more for the fauns and the dryads than for him.", "At last the end drew near, and Kalos discoursed of things beyond this life.", "Musides, weeping, promised him a sepulchre more lovely

it exclaimed in surprise; and Musides seemed at once fascinated and repelled.", "Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to the Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty statue was finished.", "By this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions, exceeding all other trees of its kind, and sending out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which Musides labored.", "As many visitors came to view the prodigious tree, as to admire the art of the sculptor, so that Musides was seldom alone.", "But he did not mind his multitude of guests; indeed, he seemed to dread being alone now that his absorbing work was done.", "The bleak mountain wind, sighing through the olive grove and the tomb-tree, had an uncanny way of forming vaguely articulate sounds.", "The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant's emissaries came to Tegea.", "It was definitely known that they had come to bear away the great image of Tyche and bring eternal honour to Musides, so their reception by the proxenoi was of great warmth.", "As the night wore on a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of Maenalus, and the men from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town.", "They talked of their illustrious Tyrant, and of the splendour of his capital and exulted in the glory of the statue which Musides had wrought for him.", "And then the men of Tegea spoke of the goodness of Musides, and of his heavy grief for his friend and how not even the coming laurels of art could console him in the absence of Kalos, who might have worn those laurels instead.", "Of the tree which grew by the tomb, near the head of Kalos, they also spoke.", "The wind shrieked more horribly, and both the Syracusans and the Arcadians prayed to Aiolos.", "In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant's messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done strange things.", "Slaves' cries ascended from a scene of desolation, and no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein Musides had dreamed and toiled.", "Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peri-style had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins.", "Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos.", "And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment, for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of Tyche, no trace could be discovered.", "Amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt, and the representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans that they had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown.", "However, the Syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in Athens, and the Tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple commemorating the gifts, virtues, and brotherly piety of Musides.", "But the olive grove still stands, as does the tree growing out of the tomb of Kalos, and the old bee-keeper told me that sometimes the boughs whisper

magazine-cover hack can splash paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or a Witches' Sabbath or a portrait of the devil, but only a great painter can make such a thing really scare or ring true.", "That's because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fear\u2014the exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness.", "I don't have to tell you why a Fuseli really brings a shiver while a cheap

there's all the difference in the world between the vital, breathing things drawn from Nature or models and the artificial truck that commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule.", "Well, I should say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which makes models, or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral world he lives in.", "Anyhow, he manages to turn out

mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre Dame and Mont Saint-Michel.", "They believed all sorts of things\u2014and maybe they saw all sorts of things, too, for the Middle Ages had some curious phases.", "I remember your asking Pickman yourself once, the year before you went away, wherever in thunder he got such ideas and visions.", "Wasn't that a nasty laugh he gave you?", "It was partly because of that laugh that Reid dropped him.", "Reid, you know, had just taken up comparative pathology, and was full of pompous 'inside stuff' about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical symptom.", "He said Pickman repelled him more and more every day, and almost frightened him towards the last\u2014that the fellow's features and expression were slowly developing in a way he didn't like; in a way that wasn't human.", "He had a lot of talk about diet, and mid Pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree.", "I

in Salem\u2014you know Pickman comes of old Salem stock, and had a witch ancestor hanged in 1692.", "I got into the habit of calling on Pickman quite often, especially after I began making notes for a monograph on weird art.", "Probably it was his work which put the idea into my head, and anyhow, I found him a mine of data and suggestions when I came to develop it.", "He showed me all the paintings and drawings he had about; including some pen-and-ink sketches that would, I verily believe, have got him kicked out of the club if many of the members had seen them.", "Before long I was pretty nearly a devotee, and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him for the Danvers asylum.", "My hero-worship, coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him, made him get very confidential with me; and one evening he hinted that if I were fairly close-mouthed and none too

stupid to question the past very closely.", "What do maps and records and guide-books really tell of the North End?", "Bah!", "At a guess I'll guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of Prince Street that aren't suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them.", "And what do those Dagoes know of their meaning?", "No, Thurber, these ancient places are dreaming gorgeously and over-flowing with wonder and terror and escapes from the commonplace, and yet there's not a living soul to understand or profit by them.", "Or rather, there's only one living soul\u2014for I haven't been digging around in the past for nothing!", "'See here, you're interested in this sort of thing.", "What if I told you that I've got another studio up there, where I can catch the night-spirit of antique horror and paint things that I couldn't even think of in Newbury Street?", "Naturally I don't tell those cursed old maids at the club\u2014with Reid, damn him, whispering even as it is that I'm a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution.", "Yes, Thurber, I decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as beauty from life, so I did some exploring in places where I had reason to know terror lives.", "'I've got a place that I don't believe three living Nordic men besides myself have ever seen.", "It isn't so very far from the elevated as distance goes, but it's centuries away as the soul goes.", "I took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellar\u2014one of the sort I told you about.", "The shack's almost tumbling down so that nobody else would live there, and I'd hate to tell you how little I pay for it.", "The windows are boarded up, but I like that all the better, since I don't want daylight

don't want to attract attention with a taxi in such a place.", "We can take the shuttle at the South Station for Battery Street, and after that the walk isn't much.'", "Well, Eliot, there wasn't much for me to do after that harangue but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight.", "We changed to the elevated at the South Station, and at about twelve o'clock had climbed down the steps at Battery Street and struck along the old waterfront past Constitution Wharf.", "I didn't keep track of the cross streets, and can't tell you yet which it was we turned up, but I know it wasn't Greenough Lane.", "When we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley I ever saw in my life, with crumbling-looking gables, broken small-paned windows, and archaic chimneys that stood out half-disintegrated against the moonlit sky.", "I don't believe there were three houses in sight that hadn't been standing in Cotton Mather's time\u2014certainly I glimpsed at least two with an overhang, and once I thought I saw a peaked roof-line of the almost forgotten pre-gambrel type, though antiquarians tell us there are none left in Boston.", "From that alley, which had a dim light, we turned to the left into an equally silent and still narrower alley with no light at all: and in a minute made what I think was an obtuse-angled bend towards the right in the dark.", "Not long after this Pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian ten-panelled door that looked damnably worm-eaten.", "Unlocking it, he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once splendid dark-oak panelling\u2014simple, of course, but thrillingly suggestive of the times of Andros and Phipps and the Witchcraft.", "Then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to make myself at home.", "Now, Eliot, I'm what the man in the street would call fairly 'hard-boiled,' but I'll confess that what I saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn.", "They were his pictures, you know\u2014the ones he couldn't paint or even show in Newbury Street\u2014and he was right when he said he had 'let himself go.'", "Here\u2014have another drink\u2014I need one anyhow!", "There's no use in my trying to tell you what they were like, because the awful, the blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify.", "There was none of the exotic technique you see in Sidney Sime, none of the trans-Saturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that Clark Ashton Smith uses to freeze the blood.", "The backgrounds were mostly old churchyards, deep woods, cliffs by the sea, brick tunnels, ancient panelled rooms, or simple vaults of masonry.", "Copp's Hill Burying Ground, which could not be many blocks away from this very house, was a favourite scene.", "The madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foreground\u2014for Pickman's morbid art was pre-eminently one of demoniac portraiture.", "These figures were seldom completely human, but often approached humanity in varying degree.", "Most of the bodies, while roughly bipedal, had a forward slumping, and a vaguely canine cast.", "The texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant rubberiness.", "Ugh!", "I can see them now!", "Their occupations\u2014well, don't ask me to be too precise.", "They were usually feeding\u2014I won't say on what.", "They were sometimes shown in groups in cemeteries or underground passages, and often appeared to be in battle over their prey\u2014or rather, their treasure-trove.", "And what damnable expressiveness Pickman sometimes gave the sightless faces of this charnel booty!", "Occasionally the things were shown leaping through open windows at night, or squatting on the chests of sleepers, worrying at their throats.", "One canvas showed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on Gallows Hill, whose dead face held a close kinship to theirs.", "But don't get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting which struck me faint.", "I'm not a three-year-old kid, and I'd seen much like this before.", "It was the faces, Eliot, those accursed faces, that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of life!", "By God, man, I verily believe they were alive!", "That nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment, and his brush had been a nightmare-spawning wand.", "Give me that decanter, Eliot!", "There was one thing called 'The Lesson'\u2014Heaven pity me, that I ever saw it!", "Listen\u2014can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless dog-like things in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like themselves?", "The price of a changeling, I suppose\u2014you know the old myth about how the weird people leave their spawn in cradles in exchange for the human babes they steal.", "Pickman was showing what happens to those stolen babes\u2014how they grow up\u2014and then I began to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and non-human figures.", "He was, in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly non-human and the degradedly human, establishing a sardonic linkage and evolution.", "The dog-things were developed from mortals!", "And no sooner had I wondered what he made of their own young as left with mankind in the form of changelings, than my eye caught a picture embodying that very thought.", "It was that of an ancient Puritan interior\u2014a heavily beamed room with lattice windows, a settle, and clumsy seventeenth-century furniture, with the family sitting about while the father read from the Scriptures.", "Every face but one showed nobility and reverence, but that one reflected the mockery of the pit.", "It was that of a young man in years, and no doubt belonged to a supposed son of that pious father, but in essence it was the kin of the unclean things.", "It was their changeling\u2014and in a spirit of supreme irony Pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to his own.", "By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to see his 'modern studies.'", "I hadn't been able to give him much of my opinions\u2014I was too speechless with fright and loathing\u2014but I think he fully understood and felt highly complimented.", "And now I want to assure you again, Eliot, that I'm no mollycoddle to scream at anything which shows a bit of departure from the usual.", "I'm middle-aged and decently sophisticated, and I guess you saw enough of me in France to know I'm not easily knocked out.", "Remember, too, that I'd just about recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial New England into a kind of annex of hell.", "Well, in spite of all this, that next room forced a real scream out of me, and I had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over.", "The other chamber had shown a pack of ghouls and witches over-running the world of our forefathers, but this one brought the horror right into our own daily life!", "God, how that man could paint!", "There was a study called 'Subway Accident,' in which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from some unknown catacomb through a crack in the floor of the Boston Street subway and attacking a crowd of people on the platform.", "Another showed a dance on Copp's Hill among the tombs with the background of today.", "Then there were any number of cellar views, with monsters creeping in through holes and rifts in the masonry and grinning as they squatted behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their first victim to descend the stairs.", "One disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast cross-section of Beacon Hill, with ant-like armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground.", "Dances in the modern cemeteries were freely pictured, and another conception somehow shocked me more than all the rest\u2014a scene in an unknown vault, where scores of the beasts crowded about one who had a well-known Boston guidebook and was evidently reading aloud.", "All were pointing to a certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that I almost thought I heard the fiendish echoes.", "The title of the picture was, 'Holmes, Lowell and Longfellow Lie Buried in Mount Auburn.'", "As I gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry and morbidity, I began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing.", "In the first place, I said to myself, these things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous crudity they showed in Pickman.", "The fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the mortal tenement.", "In the second place, they terrified because of their very greatness.", "Their art was the art that convinced\u2014when we saw the pictures we saw the demons themselves and were afraid of them.", "And the queer part was, that Pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie.", "Nothing was blurred, distorted, or conventionalized; outlines were sharp and lifelike, and details were almost painfully defined.", "And the faces!", "It was not any mere artist's interpretation that we saw; it was pandemonium itself, crystal clear in stark objectivity.", "That was it, by Heaven!", "The man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at all\u2014he did not even try to give us the churning, prismatic ephemera of dreams, but coldly and sardonically reflected some stable, mechanistic, and well-established horror\u2014world which he saw fully, brilliantly, squarely, and unfalteringly.", "God knows what that world can have been, or where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and crawled through it; but whatever the baffling source of his images, one thing was plain.", "Pickman was in every sense\u2014in conception and in execution\u2014a thorough, painstaking, and almost scientific realist.", "My host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio, and I braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases.", "As we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he fumed his flash-light to a corner of the large open space at hand, revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor.", "We walked nearer, and I saw that it must be five feet across, with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the ground level\u2014solid work of the seventeenth century, or I was much mistaken.", "That, Pickman said, was the kind of thing he had been talking about\u2014an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill.", "I noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up, and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover.", "Thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if Pickman's wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size, provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio.", "An acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for work.", "The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs, and showed the painstaking methods of the artist.", "Scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which Pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions.", "The man was great\u2014I say it even now, knowing as much as I do.", "A large camera on a table excited my notice, and Pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds, so that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting his oufit around the town for this or that view.", "He thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work, and declared he employed them regularly.", "There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half-finished monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream\u2014the second I had emitted that night.", "It echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar, and I had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter.", "Merciful Creator!", "Eliot, but I don't know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy.", "It doesn't seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that!", "It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy.", "Its position was a kind of crouch, and as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its present prey and seek a juicier morsel.", "But damn it all, it wasn't even the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountain-head of all panic\u2014not that, nor the dog face with its pointed ears, bloodshot eyes, flat nose, and drooling lips.", "It wasn't the scaly claws nor the mould-caked body nor the half-hooved feet\u2014none of these, though any one of them might well have driven an excitable man to madness.", "It was the technique, Eliot\u2014the cursed, the impious, the unnatural technique!", "As I am a living being, I never elsewhere saw the actual breath of life so fused into a canvas.", "The monster was there\u2014it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared\u2014and I knew that only a suspension of Nature's laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a model\u2014without some glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the Fiend has ever had.", "Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled up\u2014probably, I thought, a photograph from which Pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance.", "I reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly I saw Pickman start as if shot.", "He had been listening with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar, and now he seemed struck with a fright which, though not comparable to my own, had in it more of the physical than of the spiritual.", "He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence, then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him.", "I think I was paralysed for an instant.", "Imitating Pickman's listening", ", I fancied I heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere, and a series of squeals or beats in a direction I couldn't determine.", "I thought of huge rats and shuddered.", "Then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh\u2014a furtive, groping kind of clatter, though I can't attempt to convey what I mean in words.", "It was like heavy wood falling on stone or brick\u2014wood on brick\u2014what did that make me think of?", "It came again, and louder.", "There was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther than it had fallen before.", "After that followed a sharp grating noise, a shouted gibberish from Pickman, and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver, fired spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect.", "A muffled squeal or squawk, and a thud.", "Then more wood and brick grating, a pause, and the opening of the door\u2014at which I'll confess I started violently.", "Pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon, cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient well.", "'The deuce knows what they eat, Thurber,' he grinned, 'for those archaic tunnels touched graveyard and witch-den and sea-coast.", "But whatever it is, they must have run short, for they were devilish anxious to get out.", "Your yelling stirred them up, I fancy.",

it was the living nightingale, perched on a branch outside.", "It had heard of the emperor's need, and had come to bring comfort and hope to him.", "As it sang the faces round became fainter and fainter, and the blood coursed with fresh vigour in the emperor's veins and through his feeble limbs.", "Even Death himself listened to the song and said, 'Go on, little nightingale, go on!'", "'Yes, if you give me the gorgeous golden sword; yes, if you give me the imperial banner; yes, if you give me the emperor's crown.'", "And Death gave back each of these treasures for a song, and the nightingale went on singing.", "It sang about the quiet churchyard, when the roses bloom, where the elder flower scents the air, and where the fresh grass is ever moistened anew by the tears of the mourner.", "This song brought to Death a longing for his own garden, and, like a cold grey mist, he passed out of the window.", "'Thanks, thanks!' said the emperor; 'you heavenly little bird, I know you!", "I banished you from my kingdom, and yet you have charmed the evil visions away from my bed by your song, and even Death away from my heart!", "How can I ever repay you?'", "'You have rewarded me,' said the nightingale.", "I brought the tears to your eyes, the very first time I ever sang to you, and I shall never forget it!", "Those are the jewels which gladden the heart of a singer;\u2014but sleep now, and wake up fresh and strong!", "I will sing to you!'", "Then it sang again, and the emperor fell into a sweet refreshing sleep.", "The sun shone in at his window, when he woke refreshed and well;

Tham entirely and gave his attention to the others.", "Possibly Tham was telling the truth about going straight.", "And here before Craddock was the situation for a crime.", "By watching closely,

informed him they would all go to the station and arrange matters there.", "Since the victim was one of them, they\u2019d go in the subway instead of calling the wagon.", "Thubway Tham exulted.", "One of his enemies had lost a wallet temporarily, and another was in the toils of the law for theft.", "And there was a chance\u2014\u2014 Thubway Tham remembered the forty dollars his day of honest toil had cost him.", "He wanted that forty, and needed it.", "As Detective Craddock started for the nearest subway entrance with his prisoner and the victim, Thubway Tham followed, shadowing the trio as well as ever detective shadowed a suspect.", "They got into a crowded car, and Tham kept Craddock from seeing him.", "And then he began working his way forward, in such a manner as not to attract undue attention to himself.", "Finally he was two feet behind Detective Craddock in the midst of the crowd.", "The proper station was reached, the doors were opened.", "Detective Craddock started to leave the car with his two men.", "Thubway Tham stepped up close behind him for an instant\u2014and in that instant his hand dived into Craddock\u2019s pocket and took out the countryman\u2019s

evil-looking youth would be gone, and by the same token the countryman would demand to be reimbursed for his wallet.", "Craddock\u2019s only explanation would be that he had had his own pocket picked.", "He might even remember that Thubway Tham had been near at hand, and suspect him\u2014but suspicion would net him nothing.", "Craddock would have to get Tham \u201cwith the goods on\u201d in

the alley to the next street.", "He made his way to a certain saloon, sat at a table in the rear, and brooded over his wrongs.", "It was getting hard for a prominent pickpocket to make a living, he decided.", "And it didn\u2019t pay to be honest when it cost a man forty dollars a day and his wages were but fifteen a week.", "Tham moped for an hour and then went out upon the streets again.", "He stood on a corner and contemplated a crowd, wondering whether to risk fortune by picking a pocket there.", "It was against his principles to work anywhere but in the subway, but he told himself that

don\u2019t get gay with me!", "You know what I did, young feller?", "I raised Cain, I did!", "I said as how there was \u201ca hundred dollars in that wallet, and I demanded that the detective pay me back.", "He argued some about it and then took me to another room, and we argued some more.", "Finally he give me fifty, and I called it square.", "I reckon these New York slickers don\u2019t get the

I\u2019ll buy you a drink.", "Come along.\u201d", "He led the way to the nearest resort that had plenty of bright lights.", "He ordered drinks and paid for them, and whispered to the countryman about the joke, and they had more drinks and laughed aloud at Detective Craddock.", "\u201cI know a better place than this,\u201d Tham said; and led the way.", "But it seemed impossible to get a finger into that vest pocket where the countryman kept the currency.", "It was not that the visitor to the city was on guard, particularly, but luck was against Tham.", "They went along a dark side street, but Tham had no chance to get the money.", "He tried to get his man intoxicated in another resort, but found that he could not.", "So they drifted about the city for two hours, and finally Thubway Tham began to have hopes.", "The countryman began exhibiting the first signs of intoxication.", "Tham decided that he\u2019d make the attempt soon now.", "And then the visitor to the city took the wind out of his sails.", "\u201cYou look like an honest young feller,\u201d he said.", "\u201cAnd you know all about this town.", "I can\u2019t enjoy myself while I\u2019m worryin\u2019 about my money.", "You

the bills, but when midnight came, and the visitor decided that he would return to his hotel and go to bed, there remained something like seventy-five dollars.", "Thubway Tham handed it back, made the

the evening, and the proprietor hailed him.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t play any game like this on me, Tham,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWhat ith the matter with you?\u201d", "\u201cYou were in here with a

well throw himself into the sea.", "What is to be done?", "we can only look on and burst.\"", "These and other words flew from the bow of their mouth, like poisoned arrows aimed at the butt of Corvetto's ruin.", "Alas for him who is condemned to that infernal den the court, where flattery is sold by kilderkins, malignity and ill offices are measured out in bushels, deceit and treachery are weighed by the ton!", "But who can count all the bits of orange-peel these courtiers put under his feet to make him slip, or tell the soap of falseness with which they besmeared the ladder to the king's ears, to make Corvette fall and break his neck?", "who can tell the pitfalls of deceit dug in the king's brain, and covered over with the sticks and straws of pretended zeal, to make him tumble?", "But Corvetto, who was enchanted, and perceived the traps and discovered the tricks, was aware of all the nets, and was up to all the intrigues, the ambuscades, the plots and conspiracies of his enemies, kept his ears always on the alert and his eyes open, in order not to set a false step, well knowing that the fortune of courtiers is glass.", "But the higher the lad continued to rise, the lower the others fell; and at last being puzzled to know how to take him off his feet, as their slander was not believed, they thought of leading him to a precipice by the path of flattery (an art invented in a certain hot house, and perfected in the court), which they attempted in the following manner.", "Ten miles distant from Scotland, where the seat of this king was, there dwelt an ogre, the most inhuman and savage that had ever been in ogre-land, who, being persecuted by the king, had fortified himself in a lonesome wood on the top of a mountain, where no bird ever flew, and which was so thick and tangled that it could never get a sight of the sun.", "This ogre had a most beautiful horse, which looked as if it were formed with a pencil; and amongst other wonderful things was that it could speak like any man.", "Now the courtiers, who knew how wicked the ogre was, how thick the wood, how high the mountain, and how difficult it was to get at the horse, went to the king, and telling him minutely the perfections of the animal, which was a thing worthy of a king, added that he ought to endeavour by all means to get it out of the ogre's claws, and that Corvetto was just the lad to do this, as he was expert and clever at escaping out of the fire.", "The king, who knew not that under the flowers of these words a serpent was concealed, instantly called Corvetto, and said to him, \"If you love me, see that in some way or another you obtain for me the horse of my enemy the ogre, and you shall have no cause to regret having done me this service.\"", "Corvetto knew well that this drum was sounded by those who wished him ill; nevertheless, to obey the king, he set out and took the road to the mountain; then going very quietly to the ogre's stable, he saddled and mounted the horse, and fixing his feet firmly in the stirrup took his way back.", "But as soon as the horse saw himself spurred out of the palace, he cried aloud, \"Hollo!", "be on your guard!", "Corvetto is riding off with me.\"", "At this alarm the ogre instantly set out, with all the animals that served him, to cut Corvetto in pieces: from this side jumped an ape, from that was seen a large bear, here sprang forth a lion, there came running a wolf.", "But the youth, by the aid of bridle and spur, distanced the mountain, and galloping without stop to the city, arrived at the court, where he presented the horse to the king.", "Then the king embraced him more than a son, and pulling out his purse filled his hands with crown-pieces.", "At this the rage of the courtiers knew no bounds; and whereas at first they were pulled up with a little pipe, they were now bursting with the blasts of a smith's bellows; seeing that the crowbars with which they thought to lay Corvetto's good fortune in ruins, only served to smooth the road to his prosperity.", "Knowing however that walls are not levelled by the first attack of the battering-ram, they resolved to try their luck a second time, and said to the king, \"We wish you joy of the beautiful horse!", "it will indeed be an ornament to the royal stable; but what a pity you have not the ogre's tapestry, which is a thing more beautiful than words can tell, and would spread your fame far and wide!", "there is no one however able to procure this treasure but Corvetto, who is just the lad to do such a kind of service.\"", "Then the king, who danced to every tune, and ate only the peel of this bitter but sugared fruit, called Corvetto, and begged him to procure for him the ogre's tapestry.", "Off went Corvetto, and in four seconds was on the top of the mountain where the ogre lived: then passing unseen into the chamber in which he slept, he hid himself under the bed, and waited as still as a mouse, until Night, to make the Stars laugh, puts a carnival-mask on the face of the Sky.", "And as soon as the ogre and his wife were gone to bed, Corvetto stripped the walls of the chamber very quietly, and wishing to steal the counterpane of the bed likewise, he began to pull it gently.", "Thereupon the ogre, suddenly starting up, told his wife not to pull so, for she was dragging all the clothes off him, and would give him his death of cold.", "\"Why you are uncovering me!\" answered the ogress; \"there's not a thing left upon me!\"", "\"Where the deuce is the counterpane?\" replied the ogre; and stretching out his hand to the floor, he touched Corvetto's face; whereupon he set up a loud cry, \"The monaciello!", "the monacielloSee note, page 15.!", "hollo, here, lights! run quickly!\"", "till the whole house was turned topsy-turvy with the noise.", "But Corvetto, after throwing the clothes out of the window, let himself drop down upon them.", "Then making up a good bundle, he set out on the road to the city, where the reception he met with from the king, and the vexation of the courtiers, who were bursting with spite, are not to be told.", "Nevertheless they laid a plan to fall upon Corvetto with the rear-guard of their roguery, and went again to the king, who was almost beside himself with delight at the tapestry, which was not only of silk embroidered with gold, but had besides more than a thousand devices and thoughts worked on it; and amongst the rest, if I remember right, there was a cock in the act of crowing at daybreak, and out of its mouth was seen coming a motto in Tuscan,\u2014If", "I only see youThere is a play upon the words in the Italian,\u2014\"Sol (Sun) ch'io ti miri!\"; and in another part a drooping heliotrope with a Tuscan motto, At sunset; with so many other pretty things that it would require a better memory and more time than I have to relate them.", "When the courtiers came to the king, who was thus transported with joy, they said to him, \"As Corvetto has done so much to serve you, it would be no great matter for him, in order to give you a signal pleasure, to get the ogre's palace, which is fit for an emperor to live in; for it has so many rooms and chambers, inside and out, that it can hold an army; and you would never believe all the courtyards, porticos, colonnades, balconies, and spiral chimneys which there are, built with such marvellous architecture, that art prides herself upon them, nature is abashed, and stupor is in delight.\"", "The king, who had a fruitful brain which conceived quickly, called Corvetto again, and telling him the great longing that had seized him for the ogre's palace, begged him to add this service to all the others he had done him, promising to score it up with the chalk of gratitude at the tavern of memory.", "So Corvetto, who was a brimstone match and made a hundred miles an hour, instantly set out heels over head; and arriving at the ogre's palace, he found that the ogress had just given birth to a fine little ogreling; and whilst her husband was gone to invite the kinsfolk, she had got out of bed, and was busying herself with preparing the feast.", "Then Corvetto entering, with a look of compassion, said, \"Good-day, my good woman!", "truly you are a brave housewife!", "but why do you torment the very life out of you in this way?", "only yesterday you were put to bed, and now you are slaving thus, and have no pity on your own \ufb02esh.\"", "\"What would you have me do?\" replied the ogress, \"I have no one to help me.\"", "\"I am here,\" answered Corvetto, \"ready to help you tooth and nail.\"", "\"Welcome then!\" said the ogress; \"and as you proffer me so much kindness, just help me to split four logs of wood.\"", "\"With all my heart,\" answered Corvetto; \"but if four logs are not enow, let me split five.\"", "And taking up a newly-ground axe, instead of striking the wood, he struck the ogress on the neck, and made her fall to the ground like a pear.", "Then running quickly to the gate, he dug a deep hole before the entrance, and covering it over with bushes and earth, he hid himself behind the gate.", "As soon as Corvetto saw the ogre coming with his kinsfolk, he set up a loud cry in the courtyard, \"Stop, stop!", "I've caught him!\"", "and \"Long live the king of Wide-River!\"", "When the ogre heard this challenge, he ran like mad at Corvetto, to make a hash of him; but rushing furiously towards the gate, down he tumbled with all his companions, head over heels to the bottom of the pit, where Corvetto speedily stoned them to death.", "Then he shut the door, and took the keys to the king, who seeing the valour and cleverness of the lad, in spite of ill-fortune and the envy and annoyance of the courtiers, gave him his daughter to wife; so that the crosses of envy had proved rollers to launch Corvetto's bark of life on the sea of greatness; whilst his enemies remained confounded and bursting with rage, and went to bed without a candle;for", "The punishment of ill deeds past,", "Though long delay'd, yet comes at last.\"", "There were courtiers in plenty around the Prince who would have betrayed their anger at seeing him touched to the quick by this story, had they not possessed the art of dissembling; nor could they say which was greatest, their vexation at hearing themselves upbraided for their roguery, or their envy at Corvetto's happiness.", "But Paola now began to speak, and drew their soul out of the well of their own feelings with the book of these words"], "bn_03393628n": ["It is an evil thing, my Lord, to seek for better than wheaten bread; for a man comes at last to desire what others throw away, and must content himself with honesty.", "He who loses all, and walks on the tops of the trees, has as much madness in his head as danger under his feet; as was the case with the daughter of a king, who is the subject of the story I have now to tell you.", "There was once on a time a king of High-Hill, who longed for children more than the porters do for a funeral, that they may gather waxAt funerals and in public processions the poor people pick up the wax that falls from the tapers, and the flowers that are dropt by the way.", "; insomuch that he made a vow to the goddess Syrinx, that if she would cause him to have a daughter, he would name her Cannetella, to commemorate her having been turned into a reedCanna.", "And he prayed and prayed, until at length he found favour, and his wife Renzolla presented him with a little girl, to whom he gave the name he had promised.", "The child grew by palms, and when she was as tall as a pole, the king said to her, \"My daughter, you are now grown (Heaven bless you!)", "as large as an oak, and it is full time to provide you with a husband worthy of that pretty face.", "Since therefore I love you as my own life, and desire to please you, tell me I pray what sort of a husband you would like, what kind of a man would suit your fancy?", "Will you have him a scholar or a dunce?", "a boy, or a man in years?", "brown, or fair and ruddy?", "tall as a maypole, or short as a spigot?", "small in the waist, or round as an ox?", "Do you choose, and I am satis\ufb01ed.\"", "Cannetella, hearing these lavish offers, thanked her father, but told him that she would on no account encumber herself with a husband.", "However, being urged by the king again and again, she said, \"Not to show myself ungrateful for so much love, I am willing to comply with your wish, provided I have such a man as that he has no like in the world.\"", "Her father, delighted beyond measure at hearing this, took his station at the window from morning till evening, looking out and surveying, measuring and examining every one that passed along the street.", "And one day seeing a good-looking man go by, the king said to his daughter, \"Run, look out, Cannetella!", "and see if yon man comes up to the measure of your wishes.\"", "Then she desired him to be brought up, and they made a most splendid banquet for him, at which there was everything he could desire.", "And as they were feasting away, an almond fell out of the youth's mouth, whereupon stooping down, he picked it up dextrously from the ground and put it under the cloth; and when they had done eating, he went away.", "Then the king said to Cannetella, \"Well, my life, how does this youth please you?\"\u2014\"Take the fellow away!\" said she; \"a man so tall and so big as he should never have let an almond drop out of his mouth.\"", "When the king heard this he returned to his place at the window, and presently seeing another well-shaped youth pass by, he called his daughter, to hear whether this one pleased her.", "Then Cannetella desired him to be shown up; so he was called, and another entertainment was made.", "And when they had done eating, and the man had gone away, the king asked his daughter whether he had pleased her; whereupon she replied, \"What in the world should I do with such a miserable fellow, who wants at least to have a couple of servants with him to take off his cloak?\"", "\"If that be the case,\" said the king, \"it is plain that these are merely the excuses of a bad paymaster, and you are only looking for pretexts to refuse me this pleasure.", "So resolve quickly, for I am determined to have you married.\"", "To these angry words Cannetella replied, \"To tell you the truth plainlyFora de li diente\u2014'out of the teeth.'", "In Ireland folks say in like manner 'out of the face.', papa, and as I really feel, you are digging in the sea and making a wrong reckoning on your fingers; for I never will subject myself to any man living who has not a golden head and teeth.\"", "The poor king, seeing his daughter's head thus turned, issued a proclamation, bidding any one in his kingdom who should answer to Cannetella's wishes to appear, and he would give him his daughter and the kingdom.", "Now this king had a mortal enemy named Fioravante, whom he could not bear to see so much as even painted on a wall, who, when he heard of this proclamation, being a cunning magician, called a parcel of that evil brood to him, and commanded them forthwith to make his head and teeth of gold.", "So they did as he desired; and when he saw himself with a head and teeth of pure goldLiterally, 'four-and-twenty carats fine'\u2014the standard of pure gold., he walked past under the window of the king, who when he saw the very man he was looking for, called his daughter: and as soon as Cannetella set eyes upon him, she cried out, \"Ay, that is he!", "he could not be better if I had kneaded him with my own hands.\"", "When Fioravante was getting up to go away, the king said to him, \"Wait a little, brother,\u2014why in such a hurry?", "one would think you had a pledge in the hands of a Jew, or quicksilver in your body, or a branch of furze tied behind you.", "Fair and softly!", "I will give you my daughter, and baggage and servants to accompany you, for I wish her to be your wife.\"", "\"I thank you,\" said Fioravante, \"", "but there is no necessity: a single horse is enough, if the beast will carry double; for at home I have servants and goods as numerous as the sands on the seashore.\"", "So after arguing awhile, Fioravante at last prevailed, and placing Cannetella behind him on a horse he set out.", "In the evening, when the red horses are taken away from the corn-mill of the sky, and the white oxen are yoked in their place, they came to a stable where some horses were feeding; and leading Cannetella into it, Fioravante said to her, \"Listen!", "I have to make a journey to my own house, and it will take me seven years to get there.", "Mind therefore and wait for me in this stable, and do not stir out, nor let yourself be seen by any living person, or else I will make you remember it as long as you live.\"", "Cannetella replied, \"You are my lord and master, and I will perform your command to a tittle; but I should like merely to know what you will leave me to live upon in the meantime.\"", "And Fioravante answered, \"What the horses leave of their corn will be enough for you.\"", "Only conceive how poor Cannetella now felt, and guess whether she did not curse the hour and the moment when she was born!", "cold and frozen, she made up with her tears what she wanted in food, cursing her fate and abusing the stars, which had brought her down from a royal palace to a stable, from mattresses of Barbary wool to straw, and from nice delicate morsels to the leavings of horses.", "And she led this miserable life for several months, during which time corn was given to the horses by an unseen hand, and what they left supported her.", "But at the end of this time, as she was standing one day looking through a hole, she saw a most beautiful garden, in which there were so many espaliers of lemons, and grottos of citrons, and beds of flowers, and fruit-trees and trellises of vines, that it was a joy to behold.", "At this sight a great longing seized her for a fine bunch of grapes that caught her eye, and she said to herself, \"Come what will, and if the sky fall, I will go out silently and softly and pluck it: what will it matter a hundred years hence?", "who is there to tell my husband?", "and should he by chance hear of it, what will he do to me?", "moreover these grapes are none of the common sort.\"", "So saying she went out, and refreshed her spirits, which were weakened by hunger.", "A little while afterwards, and before the appointed time, her husband came back, and one of his horses accused Cannetella of having taken the grapes; whereat Fioravante in a rage, drawing a knife from his breeches pocket, was going to kill her; but falling on her knees upon the ground, she besought him to stay his hand from the deed, since hunger drives the wolf from the wood.", "And she begged so hard, that Fioravante replied, \"I forgive you this time, and grant you your life out of charity; but if ever again you are tempted to disobey me, and I find that you have let the sun see you, I will make mincemeat of you.", "Now mind me,\u2014I am going away once more, and shall for certain be gone seven years; so take care and plough straight, for you will not escape so easily again, but I shall pay you off the new and the old scores together.\"", "So saying he departed, and Cannetella shed a river of tears; and wringing her hands, beating her breast, and tearing her hair, she cried, \"Oh that ever I was born into the world, to be destined to this wretched fate!", "O father, how have you ruined me!", "but why do I complain of my father, when I have brought this ill upon myself?", "I alone am the cause of my  .", "Here have I been wishing for a head of gold, only to fall into troubleLiterally, pe cadere 'nchiummo\u2014'to fall into lead.'", "and die by iron.", "Alas, how richly I deserve it!", "by wishing my teeth of gold, I am making the golden tooth.", "This is the punishment of Heaven, for I ought to have done my father's will, and not have had such whims and fancies: he who minds not what his father and mother say, goes a road he does not know.\"", "Not a day passed that she did not make this lament, until her eyes were become two fountains, and her face was so thin and sallow that it went to one's heart to see her.", "Where now were those sparkling eyes?", "where those rosy apples?", "where the little smile upon that mouth?", "her own father would not have known her.", "At the end of a year the king's locksmith, whom Cannetella knew, happening to pass by the stable, she called to him, and went out.", "The smith hearing himself called by his name, and not recognizing the poor girl (she was so altered), was in utter amazement; but when he heard who she was, and how she had become thus changed, partly out of pity for the maiden and partly to gain the king's favour, he put her into an empty cask, which he had with him on a pack-horse, and trotting off towards High-Hill, he arrived at midnight at the king's palace.", "Then he knocked at the door, and the servants, going to the window and hearing that it was the locksmith, fell to abusing him soundly, calling him an ill-mannered fellow for coming at such an hour to disturb the sleep of the whole house; adding, that he would come off cheaply if they did not pelt him with stones and give him a broken pate.", "The king, hearing the uproar, and being told by a chamberlain what was the matter, ordered the smith to be instantly admitted; judging that since he made bold to come at such an unusual hour, something extraordinary must have happened.", "Then the smith, unloading his beast, knocked out the head of the cask, and forth came Cannetella, who required something more than words to make her father recognize her; and had it not been for a wart on her right arm, she might have taken herself off.", "But as soon as he was assured of the whole truth, he embraced her and kissed her a thousand times; then he instantly commanded a warm bath to be got ready, and when she was washed from head to foot, and had drest herself, he ordered breakfast to be brought, for she was dying with hunger.", "Then her father said to her, \"Who would ever have told me, my child, that I should see you in this plight?", "what a face indeed!", "who has brought you to this sad condition?\"", "And she answered, \"Alas, my dear sir!", "that Barbary Turk has made me lead the life of a dog, so that I was every hour on the point of giving up the ghostCo lo spireto a li diente,\u2014'with the breath between my teeth.'.", "But I will not tell you all I have suffered, for greatly as it exceeds human endurance, so much does it pass human belief.", "Enough, my father, that I am here!", "and never again will I stir from your feet; rather will I be a servant in your house, than a queen in the house of another; rather will I wear sackcloth where you are, than a golden mantle away from you; rather will I turn a spit in your kitchen, than hold a sceptre under the canopy of another.\"", "Meanwhile Fioravante returning home, was told by the horses that the locksmith had carried off Cannetella in the cask; on hearing which, burning with shame and all on fire with rage, of he ran towards High-Hill; and meeting an old woman who lived opposite to the king's palace, he said to her, \"What will you take, good mother, to let me see the king's daughter?\"", "Then she asked a hundred ducats; and Fioravante putting his hand in his purse instantly counted them out, one a-top of another; whereupon the old woman led him up on to the roof, from whence he saw Cannetella out on a balcony drying her hair.", "But\u2014just as if her heart had whispered to her\u2014the maiden turned that way, and perceiving the snare, rushed down the stairs and ran to her father, crying out, \"My lord, if you do not this very instant make me a chamber with seven iron doors, I am lost and undone!\"", "\"I will not lose you for such a trifle,\" said her father; \"I would pluck out an eye to gratify such a dear daughter.\"", "So, no sooner said than done, the doors were instantly made.", "When Fioravante heard of this, he went again to the old woman, and said to her, \"What shall I give you now?", "go to the king's house under pretext of selling cups of rouge, and entering the room where his daughter is, contrive to slip this little piece of paper among the bed-clothes, saying in an under tone as you place it there,", "'Let every one now soundly sleep,", "But Cannetella awake shall keep!'\"", "So the old woman agreed for another hundred ducats, and she served him faithfully.", "Woe to him who allows these vile jades to come to his house!", "for under the pretence of carrying about articles of dress, they dress your very life and honour into morocco-leather.", "Now as soon as the old woman had done this good office, such a sound sleep fell on the people of the house, that they seemed just as if they had all their throats cut.", "Cannetella alone remained awake, and when she heard the doors bursting open, she began to cry aloud as if she were burnt; but no one heard her\u2014there was no one to run to her aid; so Fioravante threw down all the seven doors, and entering the chamber seized up Cannetella, bed-clothes and all, to carry her off; but as luck would have it, the paper which the old woman had put among them fell on the ground, and the powder was spilt; whereupon the people of the house awoke, and hearing Cannetella's shrieks, they ran\u2014cats, dogs, and all\u2014and laying hold on the ogre, quickly cut him in pieces like a pickled tunny.", "Thus he was caught in the same trap that he had prepared for poor Cannetella, learning to his cost that", "\"No one suffereth greater pain", "Than he who by his own weapon is slain.\"", "When Zeza had ended her story, all were of opinion that Cannetella deserved this, and even worse, for seeking a hair inside the egg: they rejoiced however to see her at length freed from all her troubles, and observed, that she who had held her head so high and scorned all men, was brought at last to humble herself to a smith, and beg him to help her out of trouble.", "But the desire to hear Ciulla put a stop to the conversation, and the ears of all present stood erect at the motion of

with the bizarre marvels that sight implied.", "The sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying, for it was merely this: instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence, there stretched around me on the level through the grating nothing less than the solid ground, decked and diversified by marble slabs and columns, and overshadowed by an ancient stone church, whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight.", "Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions.", "My mind, stunned and chaotic as it was, still held the frantic craving for light; and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course.", "I neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost.", "I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble along I became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous.", "I passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns, and wandered through the open country; sometimes following the visible road, but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road.", "Once I swam across a swift river where crumbling, mossy masonry told of a bridge long vanished.", "Over two hours must have passed before I reached what seemed to be my goal, a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park, maddeningly familiar, yet full of perplexing strangeness to me.", "I saw that the moat was filled in, and that some of the well-known towers were demolished, whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder.", "But what I observed with chief interest and delight were the open windows\u2014gorgeously ablaze with light and sending forth sound of the gayest revelry.", "Advancing to one of these I looked in and saw an oddly dressed company indeed;

and as I stood in the brilliant apartment alone and dazed, listening to their vanishing echoes, I trembled at the thought of what might be lurking near me unseen.", "At a casual inspection the room seemed deserted, but when I moved towards one of the alcoves I thought I detected a presence there\u2014a hint of motion beyond the golden-arched doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room.", "As I approached the arch I began to perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the first and last sound I ever uttered\u2014a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause\u2014I beheld in full, frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives.", "I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable.", "It was the ghoulish shade of decay, antiquity, and dissolution; the putrid, dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation, the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide.", "God knows it was not of this world\u2014or no longer of this world\u2014yet to my horror I saw in its eaten-away and bone-revealing outlines a leering, abhorrent travesty on the human shape;

the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth.", "The vault to which I refer is an ancient granite, weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations.", "Excavated back into the hillside, the structure is visible only at the entrance.", "The door, a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron hinges, and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks, according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago.", "The abode of the race whose scions are inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb, but had long since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of lightning.", "Of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices; alluding to what they call \"divine wrath\" in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination which I felt for the forest-darkened sepulchre.", "One man only had perished in the fire.", "When the last of the Hydes was buried in this place of shade and stillness, the sad urnful of ashes had come from a distant land; to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned down.", "No one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal, and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the water-worn stones.", "I shall never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon the half-hidden house of the dead.", "It was in mid-summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation.", "In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness.", "All day I had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow; thinking thoughts I need not discuss, and conversing with things I need not name.", "In years a child of ten, I had seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng; and was oddly aged in certain respects.", "When, upon forcing my way between two savage clumps of briers, I suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault, I had no knowledge of what I had discovered.", "The dark blocks of granite, the door so curiously ajar, and the funereal carvings above the arch, aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character.", "Of graves and tombs I knew and imagined much, but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries.", "The strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its cold, damp interior, into which I vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay.", "But in that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this hell of confinement.", "Spurred on by a voice which must have come from the hideous soul of the forest, I resolved to enter the beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my passage.", "In the waning light of day I alternately rattled the rusty impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door, and essayed to squeeze my slight form through the space already provided;

though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one of my information or my resolve.", "It is perhaps worth mentioning that I was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault.", "My rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion; and I felt that the great sinister family of the burned-down mansion was in some way represented within the stone space I sought to explore.", "Mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb, before whose door I would sit for hours at a time each day.", "Once I thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward.", "The odour of the place repelled yet bewitched me.", "I felt I had known it before, in a past remote beyond all recollection;

but I know that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble I would often astonish those about me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations.", "It was after a night like this that I shocked the community with a queer conceit about the burial of the rich and celebrated Squire Brewster, a maker of local history who was interred in 1711, and whose slate headstone, bearing a graven skull and crossbones, was slowly crumbling to powder.", "In a moment of childish imagination I vowed not only that the undertaker, Goodman Simpson, had stolen the silver-buckled shoes, silken hose, and satin small-clothes of the deceased before burial; but that the Squire himself, not fully inanimate, had turned twice in his mound-covered coffin on the day of interment.", "But the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts; being indeed stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discover that my own maternal ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly extinct family of the Hydes.", "Last of my paternal race, I was likewise the last of this older and more mysterious line.", "I began to feel that the tomb was mine, and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when I might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark.", "I now formed the habit of listening very intently at the slightly open portal, choosing my favourite hours of midnight stillness for the odd vigil.", "By the time I came of age, I had made a small clearing in the thicket before the mould-stained facade of the hillside, allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of sylvan bower.", "This bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming of strange dreams.", "The night of the first revelation was a sultry one.", "I must have fallen asleep from fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that I heard the voices.", "Of those tones and accents I hesitate to speak; of their quality I will not speak; but I may say that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and mode of utterance.", "Every shade of New England dialect, from the uncouth syllables of the Puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago, seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy, though it was only later that I noticed the fact.", "At the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that I could not take oath upon its reality.", "I barely fancied that as I awoke, a light had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre.", "I do not think I was either astounded or panic-stricken, but I know that I was greatly and permanently changed that night.", "Upon returning home I went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed in vain.", "It was in the soft glow of late afternoon that I first entered the vault on the abandoned slope.", "A spell was upon me, and my heart leaped with an exultation I can but ill describe.", "As I closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to know the way; and though the candle sputtered with the stifling reek of the place, I felt singularly at home in the musty, charnel-house air.", "Looking about me, I beheld many marble slabs bearing coffins, or the remains of coffins.", "Some of these were sealed and intact, but others had nearly vanished, leaving the silver handles and plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust.", "Upon one plate I read the name of Sir Geoffrey Hyde, who had come from Sussex in 1640 and died here a few years later.", "In a conspicuous alcove was one fairly well-preserved and untenanted casket, adorned with a single name which brought to me both a smile and a shudder.", "An odd impulse caused me to climb upon the broad slab, extinguish my candle, and lie down within the vacant box.", "In the grey light of dawn I staggered from the vault and locked the chain of the door behind me.", "I was no longer a young man, though but twenty-one winters had chilled my bodily frame.", "Early-rising villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely, and marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and solitary.", "I did not appear before my parents till after a long and refreshing sleep.", "Henceforward I haunted the tomb each night; seeing, hearing, and doing things I must never reveal.", "My speech, always susceptible to environmental influences, was the first thing to succumb to the change; and my suddenly acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon.", "Later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour, till I unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion.", "My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester.", "I displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic, monkish lore over which I had pored in youth;

Made bold by this heaven-sent circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault; confident that no one could witness my entrance.", "For a week I tasted to the full the joys of that charnel conviviality which I must not describe, when the thing happened, and I was borne away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotony.", "I should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of thunder was in the clouds, and hellish phosphorescence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow.", "The call of the dead, too, was different.", "Instead of the hillside tomb, it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with unseen fingers.", "As I emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin, I beheld in the misty moonlight a thing I had always vaguely expected.", "The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles.", "Up the long drive rolled the coaches of the Boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions.", "With this throng I mingled, though I knew I belonged with the hosts rather than the guests.", "Inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand.", "Several faces I recognised; though I should have known them better

my shocking sallies I heeded no law of God, Man, or Nature.", "Suddenly a peal of thunder, resonant even above the din of the swinish revelry, clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous company.", "Red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house; and the roysterers, struck with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to transcend the bounds of unguided Nature, fled shrieking into the night.", "I alone remained, riveted to my seat by a grovelling fear which I had never felt before.", "And then a second horror took possession of my soul.",

heads.", "My father, his face lined with sorrow, stood by as I shouted my demands to be laid within the tomb; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they could.", "A blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a violent stroke from the heavens; and from this spot a group of curious villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship which the thunderbolt had brought to light.", "Ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing, I watched the spectators as they viewed the treasure-trove, and was permitted to share in their discoveries.",

swears that the rusted padlock had not been touched for fifty years when he examined it.", "He even says that all the village knew of my journeys to the tomb, and that I was often watched as I slept in the bower outside the grim facade, my half-open eyes fixed on the crevice that leads to the interior.", "Against these assertions I have no tangible proof to offer, since my key to the padlock was

Island was sighted, where we took a new point of departure.", "Three days later, a terrible gale struck us Four days we flew before it, whither, no one knew, for neither sun, moon, nor stars were at any time visible, and we could take no observation.", "Toward midnight of the fourth day, the glare of lightning revealed the Adelaide in a hopeless position, close in upon a low-lying shore, and driving straight toward it.", "All around and astern far out to sea was such a maze of rocks and shoals that it was a miracle we had come so far.", "Presently the ship struck, and almost instantly went to pieces, so great was the violence of the sea.", "I gave myself up for lost, and was indeed already past the worst of drowning, when I was recalled to consciousness by being thrown with a tremendous shock upon the beach.", "I had just strength enough to drag myself above the reach of the waves, and then I fell down and knew no more.", "When I awoke, the storm was over.", "The sun,

survivor.", "I was not, however, alone.", "A group of persons, apparently the inhabitants of the country, stood near, observing me with looks of friendliness which at once freed me from apprehension as to my treatment at their hands.", "They were a white and handsome people, evidently of a high order of civilization, though I recognized in them the traits of no race with which I was familiar.", "Seeing that it was evidently their idea of etiquette to leave it to strangers to open conversation, I addressed them in English, but failed to elicit any response beyond deprecating smiles.", "I then accosted them successively in the French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese tongues, but with no better results.", "I began to be very much puzzled as to what could possibly be the nationality of a white and evidently civilized race to which no one of the tongues of the great seafaring nations was intelligible.", "The oddest thing of all was the unbroken silence with which they contemplated my efforts to open communication with them.", "It was as if they were agreed not to give me a clue to their language by even a whisper; for while they regarded one another with looks of smiling intelligence, they did not once open their lips.", "But if this behavior suggested that they were amusing themselves at my expense, that presumption was negatived by the unmistakable friendliness and sympathy which their whole bearing expressed.", "A most extraordinary conjecture occurred to me.", "Could it be that these strange people were dumb?", "Such a freak of nature as an entire race thus afflicted had never indeed been heard of, but who could say what wonders the unexplored vasts of the great Southern Ocean might thus far have hid from human ken?", "Now, among the scraps of useless information which lumbered my mind was an acquaintance with the deaf-and-dumb alphabet, and forthwith I began to spell out with my fingers some of the phrases I had already uttered to so little effect.", "My resort to the sign language overcame the last remnant of gravity in the already profusely smiling group.", "The small boys now rolled on the ground in convulsions of mirth, while the grave and reverend seniors, who had hitherto kept them in check, were fain momentarily to avert their faces, and I could see their bodies shaking with laughter.", "The greatest clown in the world never received a more flattering tribute to his powers to amuse than had been called forth by mine to make myself understood.", "Naturally, however, I was not flattered, but on the contrary entirely discomfited.", "Angry I could not well be, for the deprecating manner in which all, excepting of course the boys, yielded to their perception of the ridiculous, and the distress they showed at their failure in self-control, made me seem the aggressor.", "It was as if they were very sorry for me, and ready to put themselves wholly at my service, if I would only refrain from reducing them to a state of disability by being so exquisitely absurd.", "Certainly this evidently amiable race had a very embarrassing way of receiving strangers.", "Just at this moment, when my bewilderment was fast verging on exasperation, relief came.", "The circle opened, and a little elderly man, who had evidently come in haste, confronted me, and, bowing very politely, addressed me in English.", "His voice was the most pitiable abortion of a voice I had ever heard.", "While having all the defects in articulation of a child's who is just beginning to talk, it was not even a child's in strength of

presence would have saved you embarrassment.", "My countrymen desire me to intercede with you to pardon the wholly involuntary and uncontrollable mirth provoked by your attempts to communicate with them.", "You see, they understood you perfectly well, but could not answer you.\"", "\"Merciful heavens!\"", "I exclaimed, horrified to find my surmise correct; \"can it be that they are all thus afflicted?", "Is it possible that you are the only man among them who has the power of speech?\"", "Again it appeared that, quite unintentionally, I had said something excruciatingly funny; for at my speech there arose a sound of gentle laughter from the group, now augmented to quite an assemblage, which drowned the plashing of the waves on the beach at our feet.", "Even the interpreter smiled.", "\"Do they think it so amusing to be dumb?\"", "I asked.", "\"They find it very amusing,\" replied the interpreter, \"that their inability to speak should be regarded by any one as an affliction; for it is by the voluntary disuse of the organs of articulation that they have lost the power of speech, and, as a consequence, the ability even to understand speech.\"", "\"But,\" said I, somewhat puzzled by this statement, \"did n't you just tell me that they understood me, though they could not reply, and are they not laughing now at what I just said?\"", "\"It is you they understood, not your words,\" answered the interpreter.", "\"Our speech now is gibberish to them, as unintelligible in itself as the growling of animals; but they know what we are saying, because they know our thoughts.", "You must know that these are the islands of the mind-readers.\"", "Such were the circumstances of my introduction to this extraordinary people.", "The official interpreter being charged by virtue of his office with the first entertainment of shipwrecked members of the talking nations, I became his guest, and passed a number of days under his roof before going out to any considerable extent among the people.", "My first impression had been the somewhat oppressive one that the power to read the thoughts of others could be possessed only by beings of a superior order to man.", "It was the first effort of the interpreter to disabuse me of this notion.", "It appeared from his account that the experience of the mind-readers was a case simply of a slight acceleration, from special causes, of the course of universal human evolution, which in time was destined to lead to the disuse of speech and the substitution of direct mental vision on the part of all races.", "This rapid evolution of these islanders was accounted for by their peculiar origin and circumstances.", "Some three centuries before Christ, one of the Parthian kings of Persia, of the dynasty of the Arsacid, undertook a persecution of the soothsayers and magicians in his realms.", "These people were credited with supernatural powers by popular prejudice, but in fact were merely persons of special gifts in the way of hypnotizing, mind-reading, thought transference, and such arts, which they exercised for their own gain.", "Too much in awe of the soothsayers to do them outright violence, the king resolved to banish them, and to this end put them, with their families, on ships and sent them to Ceylon.", "When, however, the fleet was in the neighborhood of that island, a great storm scattered it, and one of the ships, after being driven for many days before the tempest, was wrecked upon one of an archipelago of uninhabited islands far to the south, where the survivors settled.", "Naturally, the posterity of the parents possessed of such peculiar gifts had developed extraordinary psychical powers.", "Having set before them the end of evolving a new and advanced order of humanity, they had aided the development of these powers by a rigid system of stirpiculture.", "The result was that, after a few centuries, mind-reading became so general that language fell into disuse as a means of communicating ideas.", "For many generations the power of speech still remained voluntary, but gradually the vocal organs had become atrophied, and for several hundred years the power of articulation had been wholly lost.", "Infants for a few months after birth did, indeed, still emit inarticulate cries, but at an age when in less advanced races these cries began to be articulate, the children of the mind-readers developed the power of direct vision, and ceased to attempt to use the voice.", "The fact that the existence of the mind-readers had never been found out by the rest of the world was explained by two considerations.", "In the first place, the group of islands was small, and occupied a corner of the Indian Ocean quite out of the ordinary track of ships.", "In the second place, the approach to the islands was rendered so desperately perilous by terrible currents, and the maze of outlying rocks and shoals, that it was next to impossible for any ship to touch their shores save as a wreck.", "No ship at least had ever done so in the two thousand years since the mind-readers' own arrival, and the Adelaide had made the one hundred and twenty-third such wreck.", "Apart from motives of humanity, the mind-readers made strenuous efforts to rescue shipwrecked persons, for from them alone, through the interpreters, could they obtain information of the outside world.", "Little enough this proved when, as often happened, the sole survivor of the shipwreck was some ignorant sailor, who had no news to communicate beyond the latest varieties of forecastle blasphemy.", "My hosts gratefully assured me that, as a person of some little education, they considered me a veritable godsend.", "No less a task was mine than to relate to them the history of the world for the past two centuries, and often did I wish, for their sakes, that I had made a more exact study of it.", "It is solely for the purpose of communicating with shipwrecked strangers of the talking nations that the office of the interpreters exists.", "When, as from time to time happens, a child is born with some powers of articulation, he is set apart, and trained to talk in the interpreters' college.", "Of course the partial atrophy of the vocal organs, from which even the best interpreters suffer, renders many of the sounds of language impossible for them.", "None, for instance, can pronounce _v, f_, or _s_; and as to the sound represented by _th_, it is five generations since the last interpreter lived who could utter it.", "But for the occasional inter-marriage of shipwrecked strangers with the island-ers, it is probable that the supply of interpreters would have long ere this quite failed.", "I imagine that the very unpleasant sensations which followed the realization that I was among people who, while inscrutable to me, knew my every thought, were very much what any one would have experienced in the same case.", "They were very comparable to the panic which accidental nudity causes a person among races whose custom it is to conceal the figure with drapery.", "I wanted to run away and hide myself.", "If I analyzed my feeling, it did not seem to arise so much from the consciousness of any particularly heinous secrets, as from the knowledge of a swarm of fatuous, ill-natured, and unseemly thoughts and half thoughts concerning those around me, and concerning myself, which it was insufferable that any person should peruse in however benevolent a spirit.", "But while my chagrin and distress on this account were at first intense, they were also very shortlived, for almost immediately I discovered that the very knowledge that my mind was overlooked by others operated to check thoughts that might be painful to them, and that, too, without more effort of the will than a kindly person exerts to check the utterance of disagreeable remarks.", "As a very few lessons in the elements of courtesy cures a decent person of inconsiderate speaking, so a brief experience among the mind-readers went far in my case to check inconsiderate thinking.", "It must not be supposed, however, that courtesy among the mind-readers prevents them from thinking pointedly and freely concerning one another upon serious occasions, any more than the finest courtesy among the talking races restrains them from speaking to one another with entire plainness", "when it it desirable to do so.", "Indeed, among the mind-readers, politeness never can extend to the point of insincerity, as among talking nations, seeing that it is always one another's real and inmost thought that they read.", "I may fitly mention here, though it was not till later that I fully understood why it must necessarily be so, that one need feel far less chagrin at the complete revelation of his weaknesses to a mind-reader than at the slightest betrayal of them to one of another race.", "For the very reason that the mind-reader reads all your thoughts, particular thoughts are judged with reference to the general tenor of thought.", "Your characteristic and habitual frame of mind is what he takes account of.", "No one need fear being misjudged by a mind-reader on account of sentiments or emotions which are not representative of the real character or general attitude.", "Justice may, indeed, be said to be a necessary consequence of mind-reading.", "As regards the interpreter himself, the instinct of courtesy was not long needed to check wanton or offensive thoughts.", "In all my life before, I had been very slow to form friendships, but before I had been three days in the company of this stranger of a strange race, I had become enthusiastically devoted to him.", "It was impossible not to be.", "The peculiar joy of friendship is the sense of being understood by our friend as we are not by others, and yet of being loved in spite of the understanding.", "Now here was one whose every word testified to a knowledge of my secret thoughts and motives which the oldest and nearest of my former friends had never, and could never, have approximated.", "Had such a knowledge bred in him contempt of me, I should neither have blamed him nor been at all surprised.", "Judge, then, whether the cordial friendliness which he showed was likely to leave me indifferent.", "Imagine my incredulity when he informed me that our friendship was not based upon more than ordinary mutual suitability of temperaments.", "The faculty of mind-reading, he explained, brought minds so close together, and so heightened sympathy, that the lowest order of friendship between mind-readers implied a mutual delight such as only rare friends enjoyed among other races.", "He assured me that later on, when I came to know others of his race, I should find, by the far greater intensity of sympathy and affection I should conceive for some of them, how true this saying was.", "It may be inquired how, on beginning to mingle with the mind-readers in general, I managed to communicate with them, seeing that, while they could read my thoughts, they could not, like the interpreter, respond to them by speech.", "I must here explain that, while these people have no use for a spoken language, a written language is needful for purposes of record.", "They consequently all know how to write.", "Do they, then, write Persian?", "Luckily for me, no.", "It appears that, for a long period after mind-reading was fully developed, not only was spoken language disused, but also written, no records whatever having been kept during this period.", "The delight of the people in the newly found power of direct mind-to-mind vision, whereby pictures of the total mental state were communicated, instead of the imperfect descriptions of single thoughts which words at best could give, induced an invincible distaste for the laborious impotence of language.", "When, however, the first intellectual intoxication had, after several generations, somewhat sobered down, it was recognized that records of the past were desirable, and that the despised medium of words was needful to preserve it.", "Persian had meanwhile been wholly forgotten.", "In order to avoid the prodigious task of inventing a complete new language, the institution of the interpreters was now set up, with the idea of acquiring through them a knowledge of some of the languages of the outside world from the mariners wrecked on the islands.", "Owing to the fact that most of the castaway ships were English, a better knowledge of that tongue was acquired than of any other, and it was adopted as the written language of the people.", "As a rule, my acquaintances wrote slowly and laboriously, and yet the fact that they knew exactly what was in my mind rendered their responses so apt that, in my conversations with the slowest speller of them all, the interchange of thought was as rapid and incomparably more accurate and satisfactory than the fastest talkers attain to.", "It was but a very short time after I had begun to extend my acquaintance among the mind-readers before I discovered how truly the interpreter had told me that I should find others to whom, on account of greater natural congeniality, I should become more strongly attached than I had been to him.", "This was in no wise, however, because I loved him less, but them more.", "I would fain write particularly of some of these beloved friends, comrades of my heart, from whom I first learned the undreamed-of possibilities of human friendship, and how ravishing the satisfactions of sympathy may be.", "Who, among those who may read this, has not known that sense of a gulf fixed between soul and soul which mocks love I Who has not felt that loneliness which oppresses the heart that loves it best!", "Think no longer that this gulf is eternally fixed, or is any necessity of human nature.", "It has no existence for the race of our fellow-men which I describe, and by that fact we may be assured that eventually it will be bridged also for us.", "Like the touch of shoulder to shoulder, like the clasping of hands, is the contact of their minds and their sensation of sympathy.", "I say that I would fain speak more particularly of some of my friends, but waning strength forbids, and moreover, now that I think of it, another consideration would render any comparison of their characters rather confusing than instructive to a reader.", "This is the fact that, in common with the rest of the mind-readers, they had no names.", "Every one had, indeed, an arbitrary sign for his designation in records, but it has no sound value.", "A register of these names is kept, so they can at any time be ascertained, but it is very common to meet persons who have forgotten titles which are used solely for biographical and official purposes.", "For social intercourse names are of course superfluous, for these people accost one another merely by a mental act of attention, and refer to third persons by transferring their mental pictures,-- something as dumb persons might by means of photographs.", "Something so, I say, for in the pictures of one another's personalities which the mind-readers conceive, the physical aspect, as might be expected with people who directly contemplate each other's minds and hearts, is a subordinate element.", "I have already told how my first qualms of morbid self-consciousness at knowing that my mind was an open book to all around me disappeared as I learned that the very completeness of the disclosure of my thoughts and motives was a guarantee that I would be judged with a fairness and a sympathy such as even self-judgment cannot pretend to, affected as that is by so many subtle reactions.", "The assurance of being so judged by every one might well seem an inestimable privilege to one accustomed to a world in which not even the tenderest love is any pledge of comprehension, and yet I soon discovered that open-mindedness had a still greater profit than this.", "How shall I describe the delightful exhilaration of moral health and cleanness, the breezy oxygenated mental condition, which resulted from the consciousness that I had absolutely nothing concealed!", "Truly I may say that I enjoyed myself.", "I think surely that no one needs to have had my marvelous experience to sympathize with this portion of it.", "Are we not all ready to agree that this having a curtained chamber where we may go to grovel, out of the sight of our fellows, troubled only by a vague apprehension that God may look over the top, is the most demoralizing incident in the human condition?", "It is the existence within the soul of this secure refuge of lies which has always been the despair of the saint and the exultation of the knave.", "It is the foul cellar which taints the whole house above, be it never so fine.", "What stronger testimony could there be to the instinctive consciousness that concealment is debauching, and openness our only cure, than the world-old conviction of the virtue of confession for the soul, and that the uttermost exposing of one's worst and foulest is the first step toward moral health?", "The wickedest man, if he could but somehow attain to writhe himself inside out as to his soul, so that its full sickness could be seen, would feel ready for a new life.", "Nevertheless, owing to the utter impotence of the words to convey mental conditions in their totality, or to give other than mere distortions of them, confession is, we must needs admit, but a mockery of that longing for self-revelation to which it testifies.", "But think what health and soundness there must be for souls among a people who see in every face a conscience which, unlike their own, they cannot sophisticate, who confess one another with a glance, and shrive with a smile!", "Ah, friends, let me now predict, though ages may elapse before the slow event shall justify me, that in no way will the mutual vision of minds, when at last it shall be perfected, so enhance the blessedness of mankind as by rending the veil of self, and leaving no spot of darkness in the mind for lies to hide in.", "Then shall the soul no longer be a coal smoking among ashes, but a star in a crystal sphere.", "From what I have said of the delights which friendship among the mind-readers derives from the perfection of the mental rapport, it may be imagined how intoxicating must be the experience when one of the friends is a woman, and the subtle attractions and correspondences of sex touch with passion the intellectual sympathy.", "With my first venturing into society I had begun, to their extreme amusement, to fall in love with the women right and left.", "In the perfect frankness which is the condition of all intercourse among this people, these adorable women told me that what I felt was only friendship, which was a very good thing, but wholly different from love, as I should well know if I were beloved.", "It was difficult to believe that the melting emotions which I had experienced in their company were the result merely of the friendly and kindly attitude of their minds toward mine; but when I found that I was affected in the same way by every gracious woman I met, I had to make up my mind that they must be right about it, and that I should have to adapt myself to a world in which, friendship being a passion, love must needs be nothing less than rapture.", "The homely proverb, \"Every Jack has his Gill,\" may, I suppose, be taken to mean that for all men there are certain women expressly suited by mental and moral as well as by physical constitution.", "It is a thought painful, rather than cheering, that this may be the truth, so altogether do the chances preponderate against the ability of these elect ones to recognize each other even if they meet, seeing that speech is so inadequate and so misleading a medium of self-revelation.", "But among the mind-readers, the search for one's ideal mate is a quest reasonably sure of being crowned with success, and no one dreams of wedding unless it be; for so to do, they consider, would be to throw away the choicest blessing of life, and not alone to wrong themselves and their unfound mates, but likewise those whom they themselves and those undiscovered mates might wed. Therefore, passionate pilgrims, they go from isle to isle till they find each other, and, as the population of the islands is but small, the pilgrimage is not often long.", "When I met her first we were in company, and I was struck by the sudden stir and the looks and smiling interest with which all around turned and regarded us, the women with moistened eyes.", "They had read her thought when she saw me, but this I did not know, neither what was the custom in these matters, till afterward.", "But I knew, from the moment she first fixed her eyes on me, and I felt her mind brooding upon mine, how truly I had been told by those other women that the feeling with which they had inspired me was not love.", "With people who become acquainted at a glance, and old friends in an hour, wooing is naturally not a long process.", "Indeed, it may be said that between lovers among mind-readers there is no wooing, but merely recognition.", "The day after we met, she became mine.", "Perhaps I cannot better illustrate how subordinate the merely physical element is in the impression which mind-readers form of their friends than by mentioning an incident that occurred some months after our union.", "This was my discovery, wholly by accident, that my love, in whose society I had almost constantly been, had not the least idea what was the color of my eyes, or whether my hair and complexion were light or dark.", "Of course, as soon as I asked her the question, she read the answer in my mind, but she admitted that she had previously had no distinct impression on those points.", "On the other hand, if in the blackest midnight I should come to her, she would not need to ask who the comer was.", "It is by the mind, not the eye, that these people know one another.", "It is really only in their relations to soulless and inanimate things that they need eyes at all.", "It must not be supposed that their disregard of one another's bodily aspect grows out of any ascetic sentiment.", "It is merely a necessary consequence of their power of directly apprehending mind, that whenever mind is closely associated with matter the latter is comparatively neglected on account of the greater interest of the former, suffering as lesser things always do when placed in immediate contrast with greater.", "Art is with them confined to the inanimate, the human form having, for the reason mentioned, ceased to inspire the artist.", "It will be naturally and quite correctly inferred that among such a race physical beauty is not the important factor in human fortune and felicity that it elsewhere is.", "The absolute openness of their minds and hearts to one another makes their happiness far more dependent on the moral and mental qualities of their companions than upon their physical.", "A genial temperament, a wide-grasping, godlike intellect, a poet soul, are incomparably more fascinating to them than the most dazzling combination conceivable of mere bodily graces.", "A woman of mind and heart has no more need of beauty to win love in these islands than a beauty elsewhere of mind or heart.", "I should mention here, perhaps, that this race, which makes so little account of physical beauty, is itself a singularly handsome one.", "This is owing doubtless in part to the absolute compatibility of temperaments in all the marriages, and partly also to the reaction upon the body of a state of ideal mental and moral health and placidity.", "Not being myself a mind-reader, the fact that my love was rarely beautiful in form and face had doubtless no little part in attracting my devotion.", "This, of course, she knew, as she knew all my thoughts, and, knowing my limitations, tolerated and forgave the element of sensuousness in my passion.", "But if it must have seemed to her so little worthy in comparison with the high spiritual communion which her race know as love, to me it became, by virtue of her almost superhuman relation to me, an ecstasy more ravishing surely than any lover of my race tasted before.", "The ache at the heart of the intensest love is the impotence of words to make it perfectly understood to its object.", "But my passion was without this pang, for my heart was absolutely open to her I loved.", "Lovers may imagine, but I cannot describe, the ecstatic thrill of communion into which this consciousness transformed every tender emotion.", "As I considered what mutual love must be where both parties are mind-readers, I realized the high communion which my sweet companion had sacrificed for me.", "She might indeed comprehend her lover and his love for her, but the higher satisfaction of knowing that she was comprehended by him and her love understood, she had foregone.", "For that I should ever attain the power of mind-reading was out of the question, the faculty never having been developed in a single lifetime.", "Why my inability should move my dear companion to such depths of pity I was not able fully to understand until I learned that mind-reading is chiefly held desirable, not for the knowledge of others which it gives its possessors, but for the self-knowledge which is its reflex effect.", "Of all they see in the minds of others, that which concerns them most is the reflection of themselves, the photographs of their own characters.", "The most obvious consequence of the self-knowledge thus forced upon them is to render them alike incapable of self-conceit or self-depreciation.", "Every one must needs always think of himself as he is, being no more able to do otherwise than is a man in a hall of mirrors to cherish delusions as to his personal appearance.", "But self-knowledge means to the mind-readers much more than this,-- nothing less, indeed, than a shifting of the sense of identity.", "When a man sees himself in a mirror, he is compelled to distinguish between the bodily self he sees and his real self, which is within and unseen.", "When in turn the mind-reader comes to see the mental and moral self reflected in other minds as in mirrors, the same thing happens.", "He is compelled to distinguish between this mental and moral self which has been made objective to him, and can be contemplated by him as impartially as if it were another's, from the inner ego which still remains subjective, unseen, and indefinable.", "In this inner ego the mind-readers recognize the essential identity and being, the noumenal self, the core of the soul, and the true hiding of its eternal life, to which the mind as well as the body is but the garment of a day.", "The effect of such a philosophy as this--which, indeed, with the mind-readers is rather an instinctive consciousness than a philosophy --must obviously be to impart a sense of wonderful superiority to the vicissitudes of this earthly state, and a singular serenity in the midst of the haps and mishaps which threaten or befall the personality.", "They did indeed appear to me, as I never dreamed men could attain to be, lords of themselves.", "It was because I might not hope to attain this enfranchisement from the false ego of the apparent self, without which life seemed to her race scarcely worth living, that my love so pitied me.", "But I must hasten on, leaving a thousand things unsaid, to relate the lamentable catastrophe to which it is owing that, instead of being still a resident of those blessed islands, in the full enjoyment of that intimate and ravishing companionship which by contrast would forever dim the pleasures of all other human society, I recall the bright picture as a memory under other skies.", "Among a people who are compelled by the very constitution of their minds to put themselves in the places of others, the sympathy which is the inevitable consequence of perfect comprehension renders envy, hatred, and uncharitableness impossible.", "But of course there are people less genially constituted than others, and these are necessarily the objects of a certain distaste on the part of associates.", "Now, owing to the unhindered impact of minds upon one another, the anguish of persons so regarded, despite the tenderest consideration of those about them, is so great that they beg the grace of exile, that, being out of the way, people may think less frequently upon them.", "There are numerous small islets, scarcely more than rocks, lying to the north of the archipelago, and on these the unfortunates are permitted to live.", "Only one lives on each islet, as they cannot endure each other even as well as the more happily constituted can endure them.", "From time to time supplies of food are taken to them, and of course, any time they wish to take the risk, they are permitted to return to society.", "Now, as I have said, the fact which, even more than their out-of-the-way location, makes the islands of the mind-readers unapproachable, is the violence with which the great antarctic current, owing probably to some configuration of the ocean bed, together with the innumerable rocks and shoals, flows through and about the archipelago.", "Ships making the islands from the southward are caught by this current and drawn among the rocks, to their almost certain destruction; while, owing to the violence with which the current sets to the north, it is not possible to approach at all from that direction, or at least it has never been accomplished.", "Indeed, so powerful are the currents that even the boats which cross the narrow straits between the main islands and the islets of the unfortunate, to carry the latter their supplies, are ferried over by cables, not trusting to oar or sail.", "The brother of my love had charge of one of the boats engaged in this transportation, and, being desirous of visiting the islets, I accepted an invitation to accompany him on one of his trips.", "I know nothing of how the accident happened, but in the fiercest part of the current of one of the straits we parted from the cable and were swept out to sea.", "There was no question of stemming the boiling current, our utmost endeavors barely sufficing to avoid being dashed to pieces on the rocks.", "From the first, there was no hope of our winning back to the land, and so swiftly did we drift that by noon--the accident having befallen in the morning--the islands, which are low-lying, had sunk beneath the southwestern horizon.", "Among these mind-readers, distance is not an insuperable obstacle to the transfer of thought.", "My companion was in communication with our friends, and from time to time conveyed to me messages of anguish from my dear love; for, being well aware of the nature of the currents and the unapproachableness of the islands, those we had left behind, as well as we ourselves, knew well we should see each other's faces no more.", "For five days we continued to drift to the northwest, in no danger of starvation, owing to our lading of provisions, but constrained to unintermitting watch and ward by the roughness of the weather.", "On the fifth day my companion died from exposure and exhaustion.", "He died very quietly,--indeed, with great appearance of relief.", "The life of the mind-readers while yet they are in the body is so largely spiritual that the idea of an existence wholly so, which seems vague and chill to us, suggests to them a state only slightly more refined than they already know on earth.", "After that I suppose I must have fallen into an unconscious state, from which I roused to find myself on an American ship bound for New York, surrounded by people whose only means of communicating with one another is to keep up while together a constant clatter of hissing, guttural, and explosive noises, eked out by all manner of facial contortions and bodily gestures.", "I frequently find myself staring open-mouthed at those who address me, too much struck by their grotesque appearance to bethink myself of replying.", "I find that I shall not live out the voyage, and I do not care to.", "From my experience of the people on the ship, I can judge how I should fare on land amid the stunning Babel of a nation of talkers.", "And my friends, --God bless them!", "how lonely I should feel in their very presence!", "Nay, what satisfaction or consolation, what but bitter mockery, could I ever more find in such human sympathy and companionship as suffice others and once sufficed me,--I who have seen and known what I have seen and known!", "Ah, yes, doubtless it is far better I should die; but the knowledge of the things that I have seen I feel should not perish with me.", "For hope's sake, men should not miss the glimpse of the higher, sun-bathed reaches of the upward path they plod.", "So thinking, I have written out some account of my wonderful experience, though briefer far, by reason of my weakness, than fits the greatness of the matter.", "The captain seems an honest, well-meaning man, and to him I shall confide the narrative, charging him, on touching shore, to see it safely in the hands of some one who will bring it to the world's ear"], "bn_03326399n": ["Once upon a time there was a king's daughter, who was so handsome, there was nothing in the world to be compared with her for beauty, and she was called the Fair with Golden Hair: because her locks were like the finest gold, marvellously bright, and falling all in ringlets to her feet.", "She always appeared with her hair flowing in curls about her, crowned with flowers, and her dresses embroidered with diamonds and pearls.", "However it might be, it was impossible to see her without loving her.", "There was a young king amongst her neighbours, who was unmarried, very handsome, and very rich.", "When he heard all that was said about the Fair with Golden Hair, although he had never seen her, he felt so deeply in love with her, that he could neither eat nor drink, and therefore resolved to send an ambassador to ask her hand in marriage.", "He had a magnificent coach made for this ambassador, gave him upwards of a hundred horses and as many servants, and charged him particularly not to return without the princess.", "From the moment that the envoy had taken leave of the king, the whole court talked of nothing else; and the king, who never doubted that the Fair with Golden Hair would consent to his proposal, ordered immediately fine dresses and splendid furniture to be prepared for her.", "While the workmen were hard at work, the ambassador arrived at the Fair one's court and delivered his little message; but whether she was that day out of temper, or that the compliment was not agreeable to her, she answered the ambassador, that she thanked the king, but had no inclination to marry.", "The ambassador quitted the court of the princess very low-spirited at not being able to bring her with him.", "He carried back all the presents he had been the bearer of from the king, for the princess was very prudent, and was perfectly aware that young ladies should never receive gifts from bachelors; so she declined accepting the beautiful diamonds and the other valuable articles, and only retained, in order not to affront the king, a quarter of a pound of English pins.", "A proof of the estimation in which English pins were held before 1700.", "Pins were formerly in such great demand for new year's gifts in Paris, that on New Year's day, and \"the eve thereof,\" extra shops were specially licensed for their sale.", "When the ambassador reached the capital city of the king, where he was so impatiently awaited, everybody was afflicted that he did not bring back with him the Fair with Golden Hair, and the king began to cry like a child.", "They endeavoured to console him, but without the least success.", "There was a youth at court who was as beautiful as the sun, and had the finest figure in the kingdom.", "On account of his graceful manners and his intelligence he was called Avenant.", "Everybody loved him, except the envious, who were vexed that the king conferred favours upon him and daily confided to him his affairs.", "Avenant was in company with some persons who were talking of the return of the ambassador, and saying he had done no good.", "\"If the king had sent me to the Fair with Golden Hair,\" said he to them carelessly, \"I am certain she would have returned with me.\"", "These mischief-makers went immediately to the king, and said, \"Sire, you know not what Avenant asserts,\u2014That if you had sent him to the Fair with Golden Hair he would have brought her back with him.", "Observe his malice!", "He pretends that he is handsomer than you, and that she would have been so fond of him that she would have followed him anywhere.\"", "At this the king flew into a rage\u2014a rage so terrible, that he was quite beside himself.", "\"Ha, ha!\"", "he cried, \"this pretty minion laughs at my misfortune, and values himself above me!", "Go!\u2014fling him into the great tower, and let him starve to death!\"", "The royal guards hastened in search of Avenant, who had quite forgotten what he had said.", "They dragged him to prison, inflicting a thousand injuries upon him.", "The poor youth had only a little straw to lie upon, and would soon have perished but for a tiny spring that trickled through the foundations of the tower, and of which he drank a few drops to refresh himself, his mouth being parched with thirst.", "One day, when he was quite exhausted, he exclaimed, with a heavy sigh, \"What does the king complain of?", "He has not a subject more loyal than I am,\u2014I have never done anything to offend him!\"", "The king by chance passed close by the tower, and hearing the voice of one he had loved so dearly, he stopped to listen, notwithstanding those who were with him, who hated Avenant, and said to the king, \"What interests you, Sire?\u2014Do you not know he is a rogue?\"", "The king replied, \"Leave me alone; I would hear what he has to say.\"", "Having listened to his complaints, the tears stood in his eyes: he opened the door of the tower and called to the prisoner.", "Avenant came, and knelt before him in deep sorrow, and kissed his feet.", "\"What have I done, Sire, that I am thus severely treated?\"", "\"Thou hast made game of me, and of my ambassador,\" answered the king.", "\"Thou hast boasted, that if I had sent thee to the Fair with Golden Hair, thou wouldst certainly have brought her back with thee.\"", "\"It is true, Sire,\" rejoined Avenant, \"that I should have so impressed her with the sense of your majesty's high qualities, that I feel persuaded she could not have refused you; and in saying that, Sire, I uttered nothing that could be disagreeable to you.\"", "The king saw clearly that Avenant was innocent.", "He cast an angry look upon the traducers of his favourite, and brought him away with him, sincerely repenting the wrong he had done to him.", "After giving him an excellent supper he called him into his cabinet and said to him: \"Avenant, I still love the Fair with Golden Hair; her refusal has not discouraged me: but I know not what course to take to induce her to marry me.", "I am tempted to send thee to her to see if thou couldst succeed.\"", "Avenant replied that he was ready to obey him in everything, and that he would set out the next day.", "\"Hold,\" said the king; \"I would give thee a splendid equipage.\"", "\"It is unnecessary,\" answered Avenant; \"I need only a good horse, and letters of credence from your majesty.\"", "The king embraced him, for he was delighted to find him prepared to start so quickly.", "It was on a Monday morning that he took leave of the king and of his friends to proceed on his embassy, quite alone and without pomp or noise.", "His mind was occupied solely with schemes to induce the Fair with Golden Hair to marry the king.", "He had a writing-case in his pocket, and when a happy idea occurred to him for his introductory address, he alighted from his steed and seated himself under the trees to commit it to paper, so that he might not forget anything.", "One morning that he had set out at the first peep of day, in passing through a large meadow, a charming idea came into his head: he dismounted, and seated himself beside some willows and poplars which were planted along the bank of a little river that ran by the edge of the meadow.", "After he had made his note, he looked about him, delighted to find himself in so beautiful a spot.", "He perceived on the grass a large gilded carp gasping and nearly exhausted, for in trying to catch some little flies it had leaped so far out of the water that it had fallen on the grass, and was all but dead.", "Avenant took pity upon it, and, although it was a fast-day, and he might have carried it off for his dinner, he picked it up and put it gently back into the river.", "As soon as my friend the carp felt the freshness of the water, she began to recover herself, and glided down to the very bottom, then rising again joyously to the bank of the stream, \"Avenant,\" said she, \"I thank you for the kindness you have done me; but for you I should have died.", "You have saved me; I will do as much for you.\"", "After this little compliment she darted down again into the water, leaving Avenant much surprised at her intelligence and great civility.", "Another day, as he continued his journey, he saw a crow in great distress.", "The poor bird was pursued by a large eagle (a great devourer of crows), which had nearly caught it, and would have swallowed it like a lentil if Avenant had not felt compassion for its misfortune.", "\"Thus,\" he cried, \"do the strong oppress the weak.", "What right has the eagle to eat the crow?\"", "He seized his bow and arrow, which he always carried with him, and taking a good aim at the eagle, whizz!", "he sent the shaft right through its body; it fell dead, and the crow, enraptured, came and perched on a tree.", "\"Avenant,\" it cried to him, \"it was very generous of you thus to succour me, I who am only a poor crow; but I will not be ungrateful, I will do as much for you.\"", "Avenant admired the good sense of the crow, and resumed his journey.", "Entering a great wood so early in the morning that there was scarcely light enough for him to see his road, he heard an owl screeching, like an owl in despair.", "\"Hey-day!\" said he, \"here's an owl in great affliction.", "It has been caught, perhaps, in some net.\"", "He searched on all sides, and at last discovered some large nets, which had been spread by fowlers during the night to catch small birds.", "\"What a pity,\" said he, \"that men are only made to torment each other, or to persecute poor animals which do them no wrong or mischief.\"", "He drew his knife and cut the cords.", "The owl took flight: but returning swiftly on the wing,\u2014\"Avenant,\" it cried, \"it is needless for me to make a long speech to enable you to comprehend the obligation I am under to you: it speaks plainly enough for itself.", "The hunters would soon have been here.", "I had been taken, I had been dead, but for your assistance.", "I have a grateful heart; I will do as much for you.\"", "These were the three most important adventures which befel Avenant on his journey.", "He was so eager to reach the end of it, that he lost no time in repairing to the palace of the Fair with Golden Hair.", "Everything about it was admirable.", "There were diamonds to be seen in heaps, as though they were pebbles.", "Fine clothes, sweetmeats, money,\u2014the most wonderful sight that ever was seen; and Avenant thought in his heart, if he could persuade the princess to leave all this to go to the king his master, he should be very lucky indeed.", "He dressed himself in a suit of brocade, with a plume of carnation and white feathers; combed and powdered himself, washed his face, put a richly embroidered scarf round his neck, with a little basket, and in it a beautiful little dog which he had bought as he came through Bologna.", "Not \"Boulogne\" in France, as generally translated.", "Evelyn, in his Diary, speaking of Bologna in 1645, says, \"Many of the religious men nourish those lapdogs, which the ladies are so fond of, and which they here sell.", "They are a pigmy sort of spaniels, whose noses they break when puppies, which in my opinion deforms them.\"", "Avenant was so handsome, so amiable, and did everything with so much grace, that when he presented himself at the palace gate, the guards saluted him most respectfully, and they ran to inform the Fair with Golden Hair, that Avenant, ambassador from the king, her nearest neighbour, requested to be presented to her.", "At the name of Avenant, the princess said, \"That betokens something agreeable to me.", "I would wager he is a pretty fellow, and pleases everybody.\"", "\"Yes, in sooth, Madam,\" exclaimed all her maids of honour; \"we saw him from the loft in which we were dressing your flax, and as long as he remained under the windows we could do no work.\"", "\"Very pretty,\" replied the Fair with Golden Hair; \"amusing yourselves with looking at young men!\u2014Here, give me my grand gown of blue embroidered satin, and arrange my fair hair very tastefully; get me some garlands of fresh flowers, my high-heeled shoes, and my fan.", "Let them sweep my presence-chamber, and dust my throne; for I would have him declare everywhere that I am truly the Fair with Golden Hair.\"", "All her women hastened to attire her like a queen.", "They were in such a hurry that they ran against each other, and made scarcely any progress.", "At length, however, the princess passed into the great gallery of mirrors, to see if anything was wanting, and then ascended her throne of gold, ivory, and ebony, which emitted a perfume like balsam, and commanded her maids of honour to take their instruments, and sing very softly so as not to confuse any one.", "Avenant was ushered into the hall of audience.", "He was so struck with admiration, that he has since declared frequently that he could scarcely speak; nevertheless, he took courage, and delivered his oration to perfection.", "He beseeched the princess that he might not have the mortification of returning without her.", "\"Gentle Avenant,\" she replied, \"the arguments you have adduced are all of them exceedingly good, and I assure you I should be very happy to favour you more than another, but you must know that about a month ago I was walking by the river side, with all my ladies in waiting, and in pulling off my glove in order to take some refreshment that was served me I drew from my finger a ring, which unfortunately fell into the stream.", "I valued it more than my kingdom.", "I leave you to imagine the grief its loss occasioned me.", "I have made a vow never to listen to any offers of marriage, if the ambassador, who proposes the husband, does not restore to me my ring.", "You now see therefore what you have to do in this matter, for though you should talk to me for a fortnight, night and day, you would never persuade me to change my mind.\"", "Avenant was much surprised at this answer: he made the princess a low bow, and begged her to accept the little dog, the basket, and the scarf; but she replied that she would receive no presents, and bade him go and reflect on what she had said to him.", "When he returned to his lodgings, he went to bed without eating any supper, and his little dog, whose name was Cabriolle, would take none himself, and went and laid down beside his master.", "All night long Avenant never ceased sighing.", "\"Where can I hope to find a ring that fell a month ago into a great river?\" said he; \"it would be folly to attempt looking for it.", "The princess only named this condition to me because she knew it was impossible for me to fulfil it.\"", "And then he sighed again and was very sorrowful.", "Cabriolle, who heard him, said, \"My dear master, I entreat you not to despair of your good fortune: you are too amiable not to be happy.", "Let us go to the river side as soon as it is daylight.\"", "Avenant gave him two little pats, without saying a word, and, worn out with grieving, fell asleep.", "Cabriolle, as soon as he saw daybreak, frisked about so that he waked Avenant, and said to him, \"Dress yourself, master, and let us go out.\"", "Avenant was quite willing; he arose, dressed, and descended into the garden, and from the garden strayed mechanically towards the river, on the banks of which he strolled with his hat pulled over his eyes, and his arms folded, thinking only of taking his departure, when suddenly he heard himself called by his name\u2014\"Avenant!", "Avenant!\"", "He looked all around him, and could see nobody: he thought he was dreaming.", "He resumed his walk, when again the voice called, \"Avenant!", "Avenant!\"", "\"Who calls me?\" he asked.", "Cabriolle, who was very little and was looking close down into the water, replied, \"Never trust me if it be not a golden carp that I see here.\"", "Immediately the carp appeared on the surface, and said to Avenant, \"You saved my life in the nettle-tree meadow,\"Pr\u00e9 des Alisiers.\"", "\"Alisier, the lote or nettle-tree.\"", "\"Alisier gris, the grey lote.", "Alisier rouge, the red lote, both (and all the kinds thereof) strangers in England,\" writes Cotgrave in his Dictionary, Ed. 1650.", "where I must have perished but for your assistance.", "I promised to do as much for you.", "Here, dear Avenant, is the ring of the Fair with Golden Hair.", "Avenant stooped and took the ring out of my friend the carp's mouth, whom he thanked a thousand times.", "Instead of returning to his lodgings he went directly to the palace, followed by little Cabriolle, who was very glad he had induced his master to take a walk by the river side.", "The princess was informed that Avenant requested to see her.", "\"Alas! poor youth,\" said she, \"he is come to take leave of me.", "He is convinced that I required an impossibility, and he is about to return with these tidings to his master.\"", "Avenant was introduced, and presented her with the ring, saying, \"Madam, I have obeyed your commands.", "Will it please you to accept the king my master for your husband?\"", "When she saw her ring quite perfect she was so astonished\u2014so astonished\u2014that she thought she was dreaming!\"", "Really,\" said she, \"courteous Avenant, you must be favoured by a fairy, for by natural means this is impossible.\"", "\"Madam,\" he answered, \"I am not acquainted with any fairy, but I was very anxious to obey you.\"", "\"As you are so obliging,\" continued she, \"you must do me another service, without which I never will be married.", "There is a prince not far from here, named Galifron, who has taken it into his head he will make me his wife.", "He declared to me his determination, accompanying it by the most terrible threats, that if I refused him he would lay waste my kingdom; but judge if I could accept him.", "He is a giant taller than a high tower; he eats a man as a monkey eats a chestnut; when he goes into the country he carries in his pockets small cannons which he uses for pistols, and when he speaks very loud those who are near him become deaf.", "I sent word to him that I did not wish to marry, and that he must excuse me, but he has never ceased to persecute me.", "He kills all my subjects, and before anything can be done you must fight him and bring me his head.\"", "Avenant was a little astounded at this proposition; he mused for a few minutes upon it, and then answered, \"Well, Madam, I will fight Galifron; I believe I shall be conquered, but I will die as becomes a brave man.\"", "The princess was much surprised at his determination; she said a thousand things to prevent his undertaking the adventure.", "It was of no use.", "He withdrew to seek for weapons and everything else he might require.", "When he had made his preparations, he replaced little Cabriolle in his basket, mounted a fine horse, and rode into the dominions of Galifron.", "He inquired about him of all he met, and everyone told him he was a very demon whom nobody dared approach.", "The more he heard of him the more his alarm increased.", "Cabriolle encouraged him, and said, \"My dear master, while you fight him I will bite his legs; he will stoop to rid himself of me, and then you can kill him easily.\"", "Avenant admired the wit of the little dog, but he knew well enough that his help could be of little avail.", "At length he arrived in the neighbourhood of Galifron's castle.", "All the roads to it were strewed with the bones and bodies of men whom he had eaten or torn to pieces.", "He did not wait long before he saw the monster coming through a wood; his head was visible above the highest trees, and he sang in a terrible voice\u2014", "\"Ho! bring me some babies, fat or lean,", "That I may crunch 'em my teeth between!", "I could eat so many! so many! so many!", "That in the wide world there would not be left any!", "Upon which Avenant immediately sang to the same tune\u2014", "\"Ho! Here is Avenant to be seen,", "Who comes to draw your teeth so keen;", "He's not the greatest man to view,", "But he's big enough to conquer you.\"", "The rhymes were not quite adapted to the music, but he made them in a great hurry; and it is really a miracle they were not much worse, for he was in a desperate fright.", "When Galifron heard these words, he looked about him in every direction, and caught sight of Avenant, who, sword in hand, uttered several taunts to provoke him.", "They were needless, however.", "He was in a dreadful rage, and snatching up an iron mace, he would have crushed the gentle Avenant at one blow, had not a crow lighted at that instant on his head, and with its beak most adroitly picked out both his eyes.", "The blood ran down his face, and he laid about him on all sides like a madman.", "Avenant avoided his blows, and gave him such thrusts with his sword, running it up to the hilt in his body, that at last he fell bleeding from a thousand wounds.", "Avenant quickly cut off his head, quite transported with joy at his good fortune; and the crow, who had perched itself on the nearest tree, said to him: \"I have not forgotten the service you rendered me in killing the eagle which pursued me.", "I promised you I would return the obligation.", "I trust I have done so to-day.\"", "\"I owe all to you, Monsieur Crow,\" replied Avenant, \"and remain your obliged servant;\" and forthwith mounted his horse, laden with the horrible head of Galifron.", "When he reached the city, all the people followed him, crying, \"Behold the brave Avenant, who has slain the monster!\"", "So that the princess, who heard a great uproar, and who trembled lest they should come and announce to her the death of Avenant, dared not inquire what had happened.", "But the next moment she saw Avenant enter, bearing the giant's head, which still impressed her with terror, although there was no longer any occasion for alarm.", "\"Madam,\" said Avenant to the princess, \"your enemy is dead: I trust you will no longer refuse the king my master.\"", "\"Ah! pardon me,\" said the Fair with Golden Hair; \"but, indeed, I must refuse him, unless you can find means, before my departure, to bring me some water from the Gloomy Grotto.", "Hard by there is a deep cavern, full six leagues in extent.", "At the mouth of it are two dragons, who prevent any one from entering: flames issue from their jaws and eyes.", "Inside the cavern is a deep pit, into which you must descend: it is full of toads, adders, and serpents.", "At the bottom of this pit there is a small cavity, through which flows the fountain of Health and Beauty.", "Some of that water I must absolutely obtain.", "Whatever is washed with it becomes something marvellous.", "If persons are handsome, they remain so for ever; if ugly, they become beautiful: if young, they remain always young; if old, they become young again.", "You may well imagine, Avenant, that I would not quit my kingdom without some of this wonderful water.\"", "\"Madam,\" he replied, \"you are so beautiful already, that this water will be quite useless to you; but I am an unfortunate ambassador, whose death you desire.", "I go in search of that which you covet, with the certainty that I shall never return.\"", "The Fair with Golden Hair was immovable, and Avenant set out with the little dog Cabriolle to seek in the Gloomy Grotto the water of beauty.", "Everybody who met him on the road exclaimed, Tis a pity to see so amiable a youth wantonly court destruction.", "He goes alone to the grotto, when even if he had a hundred men to back him he could not accomplish his object.", "Why will the princess only demand impossibilities?\"", "Avenant passed on without saying a word, but he was in very low spirits.", "Having nearly got to the top of a mountain, he sat down to rest a little, allowing his horse to graze and Cabriolle to run after the flies.", "He knew that the Gloomy Grotto was not far from that spot, and looked about to see if he could discover it.", "He perceived a horrible rock, as black as ink, out of which issued a thick smoke; and the next minute one of the dragons, casting out fire from his mouth and eyes.", "It had a green and yellow body, great claws, and a long tail, coiled round in more than a hundred folds.", "Cabriolle saw all this, and was so frightened he did not know where to hide himself.", "Avenant, perfectly prepared to die, drew his sword, and descended towards the cavern, with a phial which the Fair with Golden Hair had given him to fill with the water of beauty.", "He said to his little dog Cabriolle, \"It is all over with me; I shall never be able to obtain the water which is guarded by those dragons.", "When I am dead, fill the phial with my blood, and carry it to the princess, that she may see what she has cost me.", "Then go to the king my master, and tell him my sad story.\"", "As he uttered these words, he heard a voice calling, \"Avenant!", "Avenant!\"", "\"Who calls me?\" he asked; and he saw an owl in the hollow of an old tree, who said to him: \"You let me out of the fowler's net in which I was caught, and saved my life.", "I promised I would do you as good a turn, and now is the time.", "Give me your phial.", "I am familiar with all the windings in the Gloomy Grotto.", "I will fetch you some of the water of beauty.\"", "Oh, I leave you to imagine who was delighted!", "Avenant quickly handed the phial to the owl, and saw it enter the grotto without the least difficulty.", "In less than a quarter of an hour the bird returned with the phial full of water, and tightly stopped.", "Avenant was in ecstasies!", "He thanked the owl heartily, and, re-ascending the mountain, joyfully took his way back to the city.", "He went straight to the palace and presented the phial to the Fair with Golden Hair, who had no longer an excuse to make.", "She thanked Avenant, gave orders for everything to be got ready for her departure, and finally set out with him on their journey.", "She found him an exceedingly agreeable companion, and said to him more than once, \"If you had wished it, I would have made you king, and there would have been no occasion for us to quit my dominions.\"", "But his answer was always, \"I would not be guilty of such treachery to my master for all the kingdoms on the face of the earth, although you are to me more beautiful than the sun!\"", "At length they arrived at the king's capital city, and his majesty, hearing the Fair with Golden Hair was approaching, went to meet her, and made her the most superb presents in the world!", "The marriage was celebrated with such great rejoicings, that folks could talk of nothing else.", "But the Fair with Golden Hair, who secretly loved Avenant, was never happy when he was out of her sight, and was always praising him.", "\"But for Avenant,\" she would say to the king, \"I should never have been here.", "For my sake he has done impossibilities.", "You should feel deeply indebted to him.", "He obtained for me the water of beauty.", "I shall never grow old, and I shall always remain handsome.\"", "The envious courtiers who heard the queen express herself thus, said to the king, \"You are not jealous, and yet you have good cause to be so.", "The queen is so deeply in love with Avenant, that she can neither eat nor drink.", "She can talk of nothing but him, and of the obligations you are under to him.", "As if any one else it had pleased you to send to her would not have done as much!\"", "\"That's quite true,\" said the king, \"now I think of it.", "Let him be put in the tower, with irons on his hands and feet.\"", "Avenant was accordingly seized, and in return for his faithful service to the king, fettered hand and foot in a dungeon.", "He was allowed to see no one but the gaoler, who threw him a morsel of black bread through a hole, and gave him some water in an earthen pan.", "His little dog Cabriolle, however, did not desert him; but came daily to console him and tell him all the news.", "When the Fair with Golden Hair heard of Avenant's disgrace, she flung herself at the king's feet, and, bathed in tears, implored him to release Avenant from prison.", "But the more she entreated, the more angry the king became, for he thought to himself, \"It is because she loves him;\" so he refused to stir in the matter.", "The queen ceased to urge him, and fell into a deep melancholy.", "The king took it into his head, that perhaps she did not think him handsome enough.", "He longed to wash his face with the water of beauty, in hopes that the queen would then feel more affection for him.", "The phial full of this water stood on the chimney-piece in the queen's chamber: she had placed it there for the pleasure of looking at it more frequently: but one of her chamber-maids, trying to kill a spider with a broom, unfortunately threw down the phial, which broke in the fall, and all the water was lost.", "She swept the fragments of glass away quickly; and not knowing what to do, it suddenly occurred to her, that she had seen in the king's cabinet a phial precisely similar, full of water, as clear as the water of beauty; so, without a word to any one, she adroitly managed to get possession of it, and placed it on the queen's chimney-piece.", "The water which was in the king's cabinet was used for the execution of princes and great noblemen who were condemned to die for any crime.", "Instead of beheading or hanging them, their faces were rubbed with this water, which had the fatal property of throwing them into a deep sleep, from which they never awakened.", "So it happened one evening that the king took down the phial which he fancied contained the water of beauty, and rubbing the contents well over his face, he fell into a profound slumber and expired.", "The little dog, Cabriolle, was the first to hear the news of the king's death, and ran with it to Avenant, who begged him to go and find the Fair with Golden Hair, and remind her of the poor prisoner.", "Cabriolle slipped quietly through the crowd, for there was great confusion at court, in consequence of the king's death, and said to the queen, \"Madam, do not forget poor Avenant.\"", "She immediately recalled to her mind all that he had suffered on her account, and his extreme fidelity.", "She left the palace without speaking to any one, and went directly to the tower, where with her own hands she took the irons off the hands and feet of Avenant, and putting a crown of gold upon his head, and a royal mantle over his shoulders, she said, \"Come, charming Avenant, I make you king, and take you for my husband.\"", "He threw himself at her feet in joy and gratitude.", "Everybody was delighted to have him for their master.", "His nuptials were the most splendid that ever were seen in the world, and the Fair with Golden Hair reigned long and happily with the handsome Avenant.", "A kindly action never fail to do.", "The smallest brings a blessing back to you.", "When Avenant preserved the carp and crow,", "And even had compassion on the woe", "Of an ill-omen'd and ill-favour'd owl,", "Who would have dream'd a feeble fish or fowl", "Would place him on the pinnacle of fame?", "When of his king he urged the tender flame,", "And won the fair he for another woo'd,",

by its shore the mighty city of Sarnath, but Sarnath stands there no more.", "It is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young, before ever the men of Sarnath came to the land of Mnar, another city stood beside the lake; the gray stone city of Ib, which was old as the lake itself, and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold.", "Very odd and ugly were these beings, as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned.", "It is written on the brick cylinders of Kadatheron that the beings of Ib were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it; that they had bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears, and were without voice.", "It is also written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist; they and the vast still lake and gray stone city Ib.", "However this may be, it is certain that they worshipped a sea-green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great water-lizard; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous.", "And it is written in the papyrus of Ilarnek, that they one day discovered fire, and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions.", "But not much is written of these beings, because they lived in very ancient times, and man is young, and knows but little of the very ancient living things.", "After many eons men came to the land of Mnar, dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai.", "And certain tribes, more hardy than the rest, pushed on to the border of the lake and built Sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth.", "Not far from the gray city of Ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of Sarnath, and at the beings of Ib they marveled greatly.", "But with their marveling was mixed hate, for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk.", "Nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the gray monoliths of Ib, for why those sculptures lingered so late in the world, even until the coming men, none can tell; unless it was because the land of Mnar is very still, and remote from most other lands, both of waking and of dream.", "As the men of Sarnath beheld more of the beings of Ib their hate grew, and it was not less because they found the beings weak, and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and arrows.", "So one day the young warriors, the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen, marched against Ib and slew all the inhabitants thereof, pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears, because they did not wish to touch them.", "And because they did not like the gray sculptured monoliths of Ib they cast these also into the lake; wondering from the greatness of the labor how ever the stones were brought from afar, as they must have been, since there is naught like them in the land of Mnar or in the lands adjacent.", "Thus of the very ancient city of Ib was nothing spared, save the sea-green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the water-lizard.", "This the young warriors took back with them as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of Ib, and as a sign of leadership in Mnar.", "But on the night after it was set up in the temple, a terrible thing must have happened, for weird lights were seen over the lake, and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the high-priest Taran-Ish lying dead, as from some fear unspeakable.", "And before he died, Taran-Ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of DOOM.", "After Taran-Ish there were many high-priests in Sarnath but never was the sea-green stone idol found.", "And many centuries came and went, wherein Sarnath prospered exceedingly, so

earth were exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river Ai and

land of Mnar and of many lands adjacent.", "The wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was Sarnath the magnificent.", "Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, in height three hundred cubits and in breadth seventy-five, so that chariots might pass each other as men drove them along the top.", "For full five hundred stadia did they run, being open only on the side toward the lake where a green stone sea-wall kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of Ib.", "In Sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans,

the landward ends of the streets, each of bronze, and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men.", "The houses of Sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony, each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet.", "With strange art were they builded, for no other city had houses like them; and travelers from Thraa and Ilarnek and Kadatheron marveled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmounted.", "But more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king.", "There were many palaces,

marble, and carven into designs of surpassing beauty.", "And in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials, so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers.", "And there were likewise fountains, which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning art.",

wrought of one piece of ivory, though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come.", "In that palace there were also many galleries, and many amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings.", "Sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts, and then were enacted stirring sea-fights, or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine things.", "Lofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath, fashioned of a bright multi-colored stone not known elsewhere.", "A full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them, wherein the high-priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings.", "On the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces; where gathered throngs in worship of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon, the chief gods of Sarnath, whose incense-enveloped shrines were as the thrones of monarchs.", "Not like the eikons of other gods were those of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon.", "For so close to life were they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones.", "And up unending steps of zircon was the tower-chamber, wherefrom the high-priests looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets, and their reflections in the lake, at night.", "Here was done the very secret and ancient rite in detestation of Bokrug, the water-lizard, and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the Doom-scrawl of Taran-Ish.",

dome of glass, through which shone the sun and moon and planets when it was clear, and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear.", "In summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans, and in winter they were heated with concealed fires, so that in those gardens it was always spring.", "There ran little streams over bright pebbles, dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues, and spanned by a multitude of bridges.", "Many were the waterfalls in their courses, and many were the hued lakelets into which they expanded.", "Over the streams and lakelets rode white swans, whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody of the waters.", "In ordered terraces rose the green banks, adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms, and seats and benches of marble and porphyry.", "And there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods.",

those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings, and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of Zokkar.", "And the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it.", "At first the high-priests liked not these festivals, for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the sea-green eikon had vanished, and how Taran-Ish had died from fear and left a warning.", "And they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake.", "But as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters.", "Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high tower, often performed the very

vinegar of Thraa.", "Of sauces there were an untold number, prepared by the subtlest cooks in all Mnar, and suited to the palate of every feaster.", "But most prized of all the viands were the great

pavilions and departed, though they scarce knew the reason for their departing.", "Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng

from Sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more.", "It was long ere any travelers went thither, and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes, who are no kin to the men of Mnar.", "These men indeed went to the lake to view Sarnath; but though they found the vast still lake itself, and the gray rock Akurion which rears high above it near the shore, they beheld not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind.", "Where once had risen walls of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher, now stretched only the marshy shore, and where once had dwelt fifty million of men now crawled the detestable water-lizard.", "Not even the mines of precious metal remained.", "DOOM had come to Sarnath.", "But half buried

beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet.", "So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.", "\u201cThey are afraid of me,

them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question.", "\u201cYou are exceedingly ugly,\u201d said the wild ducks, \u201cbut that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.\u201d", "Poor thing!", "he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor.", "After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslins, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy.", "\u201cListen, friend,\u201d said one of them to the duckling, \u201cyou

a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.\u201d", "\u201cPop, pop,\u201d sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.", "\u201cPop, pop,\u201d echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes.", "The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes.", "The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went.", "How they terrified the poor duckling!", "He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him.", "His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully.", "He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, \u201csplash, splash,\u201d he went into the water without touching him.", "\u201cOh,\u201d sighed the duckling, \u201chow thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\u201d", "And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him.", "It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move.", "He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could.", "He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it.", "Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first.", "The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way.", "There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night.", "A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage.", "The tom cat, whom the mistress called, \u201cMy little son,\u201d was a great favourite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way.", "The hen had very short legs, so she was called \u201cChickie short legs.\u201d", "She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.", "In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.", "\u201cWhat is that noise about?\u201d said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home.", "\u201cOh what a prize!\u201d", "she exclaimed, \u201cI hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck\u2019s eggs.", "I must wait and see.\u201d", "So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs.", "Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, \u201cWe and the world,\u201d for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too.", "The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts.", "\u201cCan you lay eggs?\u201d", "she asked.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cThen have the goodness to hold your tongue.\u201d", "\u201cCan you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?\u201d said the tom cat.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cThen you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.\u201d", "So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.", "\u201cWhat an absurd idea,\u201d said the hen.", "\u201cYou have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies.", "If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.\u201d", "\u201cBut it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\u201d said the duckling, \u201cand so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom.\u201d", "\u201cDelightful, indeed!\u201d said the hen, \u201cwhy you must be crazy!", "Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman\u2014there is no one in the world more clever than she is.", "Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t understand me,\u201d said the duckling.",

cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance.", "Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold.", "Then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air.", "The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, \u201cCroak, croak.\u201d", "It made one shiver with cold to look at him.", "All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.", "One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds,

shown with dazzling whiteness.", "They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea.", "As they mounted higher

cry so strange that it frightened himself.", "Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.", "He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world.", "He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they.", "Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement.", "The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller.", "At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up.", "He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.", "Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened.", "He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife.", "The warmth revived the poor little creature.", "But when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.", "Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.", "He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again.",

escaped.", "The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.", "It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes.", "He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring.", "Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air.", "They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened.", "The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn.", "Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring.", "From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans,

birds,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cand they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter; better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\u201d", "Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans.", "The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.", "\u201cKill me,\u201d said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.", "But what did he see in the clear stream below?", "His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan.", "To be born in a duck\u2019s nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan\u2019s egg.", "He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.", "Into the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.", "\u201cSee,\u201d cried the youngest, \u201cthere is a new one;\u201d and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, \u201cThere is another swan come; a new one has arrived.\u201d", "Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \u201cThe new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\u201d", "And the old swans bowed their heads before him.", "Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud.", "He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds.", "Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright.", "Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \u201cI never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."], "bn_00288807n": ["In the old times of religious gloom and intolerance lived Richard Digby, the gloomiest and most intolerant of a stern brotherhood.", "His plan of salvation was so narrow, that, like a plank in a tempestuous sea, it could avail no sinner but himself, who bestrode it triumphantly, and hurled anathemas against the wretches whom he saw struggling with the billows of eternal death.", "In his view of the matter, it was a most abominable crime\u2014as, indeed, it is a great folly\u2014for men to trust to their own strength, or even to grapple to any other fragment of the wreck, save this narrow plank, which, moreover, he took special care to keep out of their reach.", "In other words, as his creed was like no man\u2019s else, and being well pleased that Providence had intrusted him alone, of mortals, with the treasure of a true faith, Richard Digby determined to seclude himself to the sole and constant enjoyment of his happy fortune.", "\u201cAnd verily,\u201d thought he, \u201cI deem it a chief condition of Heaven\u2019s mercy to myself, that I hold no communion with those abominable myriads which it hath cast off to

brimstone, or involved in whatever new kind of ruin is ordained for the horrible perversity of this generation.\u201d", "So Richard Digby took an axe, to hew space enough for a tabernacle in the wilderness, and some few other necessaries, especially a sword and gun, to smite and slay any intruder upon his hallowed seclusion; and plunged into the dreariest depths of the forest.", "On its verge, however, he paused a moment, to shake off the dust of his feet against the village where he had dwelt, and to invoke a curse on the meeting-house, which he regarded as a temple of heathen idolatry.", "He felt a curiosity, also, to see whether the fire and brimstone would not rush down from Heaven at once, now that the one righteous man had provided for his own safety.", "But, as the sunshine continued to fall peacefully on the cottages and fields, and the husbandmen labored and children played, and as there were many tokens of present happiness, and nothing ominous of a speedy judgment, he turned away, somewhat disappointed.", "The farther he went, however, and the lonelier he felt himself, and the thicker the trees stood along his path, and the darker the shadow overhead, so much the more did Richard Digby exult.", "He talked to himself, as he strode onward; he read his Bible to himself, as he sat beneath the trees; and, as the gloom of the forest hid the blessed sky, I had almost added, that, at morning, noon, and eventide, he prayed to himself.", "So congenial was this mode of life to his disposition, that he often laughed to himself, but was displeased when an echo tossed him back the long loud roar.", "In this manner, he journeyed onward three days and two nights, and came, on the third evening, to the mouth of a cave, which, at first sight, reminded him of Elijah\u2019s cave at Horeb, though perhaps it more resembled Abraham\u2019s sepulchral cave at Machpelah.", "It entered into the heart of a rocky hill.", "There was so dense a veil of tangled foliage about it, that none but a sworn lover of gloomy recesses would have discovered the low arch of its entrance, or have dared to step within its vaulted chamber, where the burning eyes of a panther might encounter him.", "If Nature meant this remote and dismal cavern for the use of man, it could only be to bury in its gloom the victims of a pestilence, and then to block up its mouth with stones, and avoid the spot forever after.", "There was nothing bright nor cheerful near it, except a bubbling fountain, some twenty paces off, at which Richard Digby hardly threw away a glance.", "But he thrust his head into the cave, shivered, and congratulated himself.", "\u201cThe finger of Providence hath pointed my way!\u201d cried he, aloud, while the tomb-like den returned a strange echo, as if some one within were mocking him.", "\u201cHere my soul will be at peace; for the wicked will not find me.", "Here I can read the Scriptures, and be no more provoked with lying interpretations.", "Here I can offer up acceptable prayers, because my voice will not be mingled with the sinful supplications of the multitude.", "Of a truth, the only way to heaven leadeth through the narrow entrance of this cave,\u2014and", "I alone have found it!\u201d", "In regard to this cave it was observable that the roof, so far as the imperfect light permitted it to be seen, was hung with substances resembling opaque icicles; for the damps of unknown centuries, dripping down continually, had become as hard as adamant; and wherever that moisture fell, it seemed to possess the power of converting what it bathed to stone.", "The fallen leaves and sprigs of foliage, which the wind had swept into the cave, and the little feathery shrubs, rooted near the threshold, were not wet with a natural dew, but had been embalmed by this wondrous process.", "And here I am put in mind that Richard Digby, before he withdrew himself from the world, was supposed by skilful physicians to have contracted a disease for which no remedy was written in their medical books.", "It was a deposition of calculous particles within his heart, caused by an obstructed circulation of the blood; and, unless a miracle should be wrought for him, there was danger that the malady might act on the entire substance of the organ, and change his fleshy heart to stone.", "Many, indeed, affirmed that the process was already near its consummation.", "Richard Digby, however, could never be convinced that any such direful work was going on within him; nor when he saw the sprigs of marble foliage, did his heart even throb the quicker, at the similitude suggested by these once tender herbs.", "It may be that this same insensibility was a symptom of the disease.", "Be that as it might, Richard Digby was well contented with his sepulchral cave.", "So dearly did he love this congenial spot, that, instead of going a few paces to the bubbling spring for water, he allayed his thirst with now and then a drop of moisture from the roof, which, had it fallen anywhere but on his tongue, would have been congealed into a pebble.", "For a man predisposed to stoniness of the heart, this surely was unwholesome liquor.", "But there he dwelt, for three days more eating herbs and roots, drinking his own destruction, sleeping, as it were, in a tomb, and awaking to the solitude of death, yet esteeming this horrible mode of life as hardly inferior to celestial bliss.", "Perhaps superior; for, above the sky, there would be angels to disturb him.", "At the close of the third day, he sat in the portal of his mansion, reading the Bible aloud, because no other ear could profit by it, and reading it amiss, because the rays of the setting sun did not penetrate the dismal depth of shadow round about him, nor fall upon the sacred page.", "Suddenly, however, a faint gleam of light was thrown over the volume, and, raising his eyes, Richard Digby saw that a young woman stood before the mouth of the cave, and that the sunbeams bathed her white garment, which thus seemed to possess a radiance of its own.", "\u201cGood evening, Richard,\u201d said the girl; \u201cI have come from afar to find thee.\u201d", "The slender grace and gentle loveliness of this young woman were at once recognized by Richard Digby.", "Her name was Mary Goffe.", "She had been a convert to his preaching of the word in England, before he yielded himself to that exclusive bigotry which now enfolded him with such an iron grasp that no other sentiment could reach his bosom.", "When he came a pilgrim to America, she had remained in her father\u2019s hall; but now, as it appeared, had crossed the ocean after him, impelled by the same faith that led other exiles hither, and perhaps by love almost as holy.", "What else but faith and love united could have sustained so delicate a creature, wandering thus far into the forest, with her golden hair dishevelled by the boughs, and her feet wounded by the thorns?", "Yet, weary and faint though she must have been, and affrighted at the dreariness of the cave, she looked on the lonely man with a mild and pitying expression, such as might beam from an angel\u2019s eyes, towards an afflicted mortal.", "But the recluse, frowning sternly upon her, and keeping his finger between the leaves of his half-closed Bible, motioned her away with his hand.", "\u201cOff!\u201d cried he.", "\u201cI am sanctified, and thou art sinful.", "Away!\u201d  \u201cO Richard,\u201d said she, earnestly, \u201cI have come this weary way because I heard that a grievous distemper had seized upon thy heart; and a great Physician hath given me the skill to cure it.", "There is no other remedy than this which I have brought thee.", "Turn me not away, therefore, nor refuse my medicine; for then must this dismal cave be thy sepulchre.\u201d", "\u201cAway!\u201d replied Richard Digby, still with a dark frown.", "\u201cMy heart is in better condition than thine own.", "Leave me, earthly one; for the sun is almost set; and when no light reaches the door of the cave, then is my prayer-time.\u201d", "Now, great as was her need, Mary Goffe did not plead with this stony-hearted man for shelter and protection, nor ask anything whatever for her own sake.", "All her zeal was for his welfare.", "\u201cCome back with me!\u201d", "she exclaimed, clasping her hands,\u2014\u201ccome back to thy fellow-men; for they need thee, Richard, and thou hast tenfold need of them.", "Stay not in this evil den; for the air is chill, and the damps are fatal; nor will any that perish within it ever find the path to heaven.", "Hasten hence, I entreat thee, for thine own soul\u2019s sake; for either the roof will fall upon thy head, or some other speedy destruction is at hand.\u201d", "\u201cPerverse woman!\u201d answered Richard Digby, laughing aloud,\u2014for he was moved to bitter mirth by her foolish vehemence,\u2014\u201cI tell thee that the path to heaven leadeth straight through this narrow portal where I sit.", "And, moreover, the destruction thou speakest of is ordained, not for this blessed cave, but for all other habitations of mankind, throughout the earth.", "Get thee hence speedily, that thou mayst have thy share!\u201d", "So saving, he opened his Bible again, and fixed his eyes intently on the page, being resolved to withdraw his thoughts from this child of sin and wrath, and to waste no more of his holy breath upon her.", "The shadow had now grown so deep, where he was sitting, that he made continual mistakes in what he read, converting all that was gracious and merciful to denunciations of vengeance and unutterable woe on every created being but himself.", "Mary Goffe, meanwhile, was leaning against a tree, beside the sepulchral cave, very sad, yet with something heavenly and ethereal in her unselfish sorrow.", "The light from the setting sun still glorified her form, and was reflected a little way within the darksome den, discovering so terrible a gloom that the maiden shuddered for its self-doomed inhabitant.", "Espying the bright fountain near at hand, she hastened thither, and scooped up a portion of its water, in a cup of birchen bark.", "A few tears mingled with the draught, and perhaps gave it all its efficacy.", "She then returned to the mouth of the cave, and knelt down at Richard Digby\u2019s feet.", "\u201cRichard,\u201d she said, with passionate fervor, yet a gentleness in all her passion, \u201cI pray thee, by thy hope of heaven, and as thou wouldst not dwell in this tomb forever, drink of this hallowed water, be it but a single drop!", "Then, make room for me by thy side, and let us read together one page of that blessed volume; and, lastly, kneel down with me and pray!", "Do this, and thy stony heart shall become softer than a babe\u2019s, and all be well.\u201d", "But Richard Digby, in utter abhorrence of the proposal, cast the Bible at his feet, and eyed her with such a fixed and evil frown, that he looked less like a living man than a marble statue, wrought by some dark-imagined sculptor to express the most repulsive mood that human features could assume.", "And, as his look grew even devilish, so, with an equal change did Mary Goffe become more sad, more mild, more pitiful, more like a sorrowing angel.", "But, the more heavenly she was, the more hateful did she seem to Richard Digby, who at length raised his hand, and smote down the cup of hallowed water upon the threshold of the cave, thus rejecting the only medicine that could have cured his stony heart.", "A sweet perfume lingered in the air for a moment, and then was gone.", "\u201cTempt me no more, accursed woman,\u201d exclaimed he, still with his marble frown, \u201clest I smite thee down also!", "What hast thou to do with my Bible?\u2014what with my prayers?\u2014what with my heaven?\u201d", "No sooner had he spoken these dreadful words, than Richard Digby\u2019s heart ceased to beat; while\u2014so the legend says-the form of Mary Goffe melted into the last sunbeams, and returned from the sepulchral cave to heaven.", "For Mary Golfe had been buried in an English churchyard, months before; and either it was her ghost that haunted the wild forest, or else a dream-like spirit, typifying pure Religion.", "Above a century afterwards, when the trackless forest of Richard Digby\u2019s day had long been interspersed with settlements, the children of a neighboring farmer were playing at the foot of a hill.", "The trees, on account of the rude and broken surface of this acclivity, had never been felled, and were crowded so densely together as to hide all but a few rocky prominences, wherever their roots could grapple with the soil.", "A little boy and girl, to conceal themselves from their playmates, had crept into the deepest shade, where not only the darksome pines, but a thick veil of creeping plants suspended from an overhanging rock, combined to make a twilight at noonday, and almost a midnight at all other seasons.", "There the children hid themselves, and shouted, repeating the cry at intervals, till the whole party of pursuers were drawn thither, and, pulling aside the matted foliage, let in a doubtful glimpse of daylight.", "But scarcely was this accomplished, when the little group uttered a simultaneous shriek, and tumbled headlong down the hill, making the best of their way homeward, without a second glance into the gloomy recess.", "Their father, unable to comprehend what had so startled them, took his axe, and, by felling one or two trees, and tearing away the creeping plants, laid the mystery open to the day.", "He had discovered the entrance of a cave, closely resembling the mouth of a sepulchre, within which sat the figure of a man, whose gesture and attitude warned the father and children to stand back, while his visage wore a most forbidding frown.", "This repulsive personage seemed to have been carved in the same gray stone that formed the walls and portal of the cave.", "On minuter inspection, indeed, such blemishes were observed, as made it doubtful whether the figure were really a statue, chiselled by human art and somewhat worn and defaced by the lapse of ages, or a freak of Nature, who might have chosen to imitate, in stone, her usual handiwork of flesh.", "Perhaps it was the least unreasonable idea, suggested by this strange spectacle, that the moisture of the cave possessed a petrifying quality, which had thus awfully embalmed a human corpse.", "There was something so frightful in the aspect of this Man of Adamant, that the farmer, the moment that he recovered from the fascination of his first gaze, began to heap stones into the mouth of the cavern.", "His wife, who had followed him to the hill, assisted her husband\u2019s efforts.", "The children, also, approached as near as they durst, with their little hands full of pebbles, and cast them on the pile.", "Earth was then thrown into the crevices, and the whole fabric overlaid with sods.", "Thus all traces of the discovery were obliterated, leaving only a marvellous legend, which grew wilder from one generation to another, as the children told it to their grandchildren, and they to their posterity, till few believed that there had ever been a cavern or a statue, where now they saw but a grassy patch on the shadowy hillside.", "Yet, grown people avoid the spot, nor do children play there.", "Friendship, and Love, and Piety, all human and celestial sympathies, should keep aloof from that hidden cave; for there still sits, and, unless an earthquake crumble down the roof upon his head, shall sit forever, the shape of Richard Digby, in the attitude of repelling the whole race of mortals,\u2014not from heaven,\u2014but from the horrible

in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest\u2014a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body.", "It did not appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.", "Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost to view.", "Doubtless there was an outpost farther along.", "The other bank of the stream was open ground\u2014a gentle slope topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the bridge.", "Midway up the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators\u2014a single company of infantry in line, at \u201cparade rest,\u201d the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock.", "A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right.", "Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man moved.", "The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless.", "The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge.", "The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign.", "Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him.", "In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.", "The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age.", "He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter.", "His features were good\u2014a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well fitting frock coat.", "He wore a moustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp.", "Evidently this was no vulgar assassin.", "The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.", "The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing.", "The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace.", "These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge.", "The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth.", "This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.", "At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.", "The arrangement commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective.", "His face had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged.", "He looked a moment at his \u201cunsteadfast footing,\u201d then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet.", "A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current.", "How slowly it appeared to move!", "What a sluggish stream!", "He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children.", "The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift\u2014all had distracted him.", "And now he became conscious of a new disturbance.", "Striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith\u2019s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.", "He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by\u2014 it seemed both.", "Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell.", "He awaited each new stroke with impatience and\u2014he knew not why\u2014apprehension.", "The intervals of silence grew progressively longer; the delays became maddening.", "With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness.", "They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek.", "What he heard was the ticking of his watch.", "He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.", "\u201cIf I could free my hands,\u201d he thought, \u201cI might throw off the noose and spring into the stream.", "By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home.", "My home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond the invader\u2019s farthest advance.\u201d", "As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man\u2019s brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant.", "The sergeant stepped aside.", "Peyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family.", "Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause.", "Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction.", "That opportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in wartime.", "Meanwhile he did what he could.", "No service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war.", "One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water.", "Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands.", "While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.", "\u201cThe Yanks are repairing the railroads,\u201d said the man, \u201cand are getting ready for another advance.", "They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.", "The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.", "I saw the order.\u201d", "\u201cHow far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\u201d", "Farquhar asked.", "\u201cAbout thirty miles.\u201d  \u201cIs there no force on this side of the creek?\u201d", "\u201cOnly a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.\u201d", "\u201cSuppose a man\u2014a civilian and student of hanging\u2014should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\u201d said Farquhar, smiling, \u201cwhat could he accomplish?\u201d", "The soldier reflected.", "\u201cI was there a month ago,\u201d he replied.", "\u201cI observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge.", "It is now dry and would burn like tinder.\u201d", "The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank.", "He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.", "An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come.", "He was a Federal scout.", "As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead.", "From this state he was awakened\u2014ages later, it seemed to him\u2014by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation.", "Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs.", "These pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity.", "They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature.", "As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness\u2014of congestion.", "These sensations were unaccompanied by thought.", "The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment.", "He was conscious of motion.", "Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum.", "Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.", "The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream.", "There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs.", "To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!\u2014the idea seemed to him ludicrous.", "He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible!", "He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer.", "Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface\u2014knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable.", "\u201cTo be hanged and drowned,\u201d he thought, \u201cthat is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.", "No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.\u201d", "He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands.", "He gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome.", "What splendid effort!\u2014what magnificent, what superhuman strength!", "Ah, that was a fine endeavor!", "Bravo!", "The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.", "He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck.", "They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake.", "\u201cPut it back, put it back!\u201d", "He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced.", "His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire, his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth.", "His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish!", "But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command.", "They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface.", "He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!", "He was now in full possession of his physical senses.", "They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert.", "Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived.", "He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck.", "He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf\u2014he saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig.", "He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass.", "The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies\u2019 wings, the strokes of the water spiders\u2019 legs, like oars which had lifted their boat\u2014all these made audible music.", "A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.", "He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.", "They were in silhouette against the blue sky.", "They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him.", "The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed.", "Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic.", "Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray.", "He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle.", "The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle.", "He observed that it was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them.", "Nevertheless, this one had missed.", "A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was again looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort.", "The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears.", "Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning\u2019s work.", "How coldly and pitilessly\u2014with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquility in the men\u2014with what accurately measured interval fell those cruel words:  \u201cCompany!\u2026 Attention!\u2026", "Shoulder arms!\u2026", "Ready!\u2026", "Aim!\u2026 Fire!\u201d", "Farquhar dived\u2014dived as deeply as he could.", "The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward.", "Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent.", "One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.", "As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream\u2014nearer to safety.", "The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets.", "The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.", "The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current.", "His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning:  \u201cThe officer,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cwill not make that martinet\u2019s", "error a second time.", "It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot.", "He has probably already given the command to fire at will.", "God help me, I cannot dodge them all!\u201d", "An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, DIMINUENDO, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps!", "A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him!", "The cannon had taken an hand in the game.", "As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.", "\u201cThey will not do that again,\u201d he thought; \u201cthe next time they will use a charge of grape.", "I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me\u2014the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile.", "That is a good gun.\u201d", "Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round\u2014spinning like a top.", "The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men, all were commingled and blurred.", "Objects were represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color\u2014that was all he saw.", "He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick.", "In few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream\u2014the southern bank\u2014and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies.", "The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight.", "He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it.", "It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble.", "The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms.", "A strange roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of AEolian harps.", "He had not wish to perfect his escape\u2014he was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.", "A whiz and a rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream.", "The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell.", "He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.", "All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun.", "The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman\u2019s road.", "He had not known that he lived in so wild a region.", "There was something uncanny in the revelation.", "By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished.", "The thought of his wife and children urged him on.", "At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction.", "It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled.", "No fields bordered it, no dwelling anywhere.", "Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation.", "The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective.", "Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations.", "He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance.", "The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which\u2014once, twice, and again\u2014he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.", "His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen.", "He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it.", "His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them.", "His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air.", "How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue\u2014he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet!", "Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene\u2014perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium.", "He stands at the gate of his own home.", "All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine.", "He must have traveled the entire night.", "As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him.", "At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity.", "Ah, how beautiful she is!", "He springs forwards with extended arms.", "As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon\u2014then all is darkness and silence!", "Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge"], "bn_01304444n": ["It is said that in Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, no man may kill a cat; and this I can verily believe as I gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire.", "For the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see.", "He is the soul of antique Aegyptus, and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in Meroe and Ophir.", "He is the kin of the jungle\u2019s lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa.", "The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten.", "In Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbors.", "Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight.", "But whatever the reason, this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel; and from some of the sounds heard after dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar.", "But the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard.", "In truth, much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees.", "When through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard after dark, the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished.", "For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats first came.", "One day a caravan of strange wanderers from the South entered the narrow cobbled streets of Ulthar.", "Dark wanderers they were, and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year.", "In the market-place they told fortunes for silver, and bought gay beads from the merchants.", "What was the land of these wanderers none could tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams and lions.", "And the leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disk betwixt the horns.", "There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother, but only a tiny black kitten to cherish.", "The plague had not been kind to him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow; and when one is very young, one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten.", "So the boy whom the dark people called Menes smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon.", "On the third morning of the wanderers\u2019 stay in Ulthar, Menes could not find his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market-place certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife, and of sounds heard in the night.", "And when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation, and finally to prayer.", "He stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand, since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming.", "It was very peculiar, but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy, nebulous figures of exotic things; of hybrid creatures crowned with horn-flanked disks.", "Nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative.", "That night the wanderers left Ulthar, and were never seen again.", "And the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found.", "From each hearth the familiar cat had vanished; cats large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow and white.", "Old Kranon, the burgomaster, swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of Menes\u2019 kitten; and cursed the caravan and the little boy.", "But Nith, the lean notary, declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold.", "Still, no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little Atal, the innkeeper\u2019s son, vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of Ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage, two abreast, as if in performance of some unheard-of rite of beasts.", "The villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard.", "So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people awakened at dawn\u2014behold!", "every cat was back at his accustomed hearth!", "Large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow and white, none was missing.", "Very sleek and fat did the cats appear, and sonorous with purring content.", "The citizens talked with one another of the affair, and marveled not a little.", "Old Kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them, since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife.", "But all agreed on one thing: that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious.", "And for two whole days the sleek, lazy cats of Ulthar would touch no food, but only doze by the fire or in the sun.", "It was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees.", "Then the lean Nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away.", "In another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful to take with him Shang the blacksmith and Thul the cutter of stone as witnesses.", "And when they had broken down the frail door they found only this: two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor, and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners.", "There was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of Ulthar.", "Zath, the coroner, disputed at length with Nith, the lean notary; and Kranon and Shang and Thul were overwhelmed with questions.", "Even little Atal, the innkeeper\u2019s son, was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward.", "They talked of the old cotter and his wife, of the caravan of dark wanderers, of small Menes and his black kitten, of the prayer of Menes and of the sky during that prayer, of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left, and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard.", "And in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in Hatheg and discussed by travelers in Nir; namely, that in Ulthar no man may kill a cat"], "bn_03505587n": ["In the happy times when Fairies existed, there reigned a King

new delights and countless festivals;", "Let shouts of joy and songs of triumph prove", "His people's loyalty, his daughters' love!\"", "When the King saw them so lovely, and in such splendid dresses,

habit to draw inferences from everything, he said to the eldest, \"Tell me, pray, why have you put on a green gown?\"", "\"Sire,\" she answered, \"having heard of your achievements, I fancied that green would express the joy and hope with which your return inspired me.\"", "\"That is very prettily said!\" exclaimed the King.", "\"And you, my child,\" he continued; \"why do you wear a blue gown?\"", "\"My liege,\" said the Princess, \"to indicate that we should unceasingly implore for you the protection of the Gods, and also that the sight of you is to me like that of heaven and all the starry host!\"", "\"You speak like an oracle!\" said the King.", "\"And you, Merveilleuse; what reason had you for dressing yourself in white?\"", "\"Because, Sire,\" she answered, \"it becomes me better than any colour.\"", "\"How!\" cried the King, very much offended; \"was that your only motive, you little coquette?\"", "\"My motive was to please you,\" said the Princess; \"it appears to me that I ought to have no other.\"", "The King, who loved her dearly, was so perfectly satisfied with this explanation, that he declared himself much pleased by the little turn she had given to her

and two white horse-hairs served as oars to row her boat with.", "All this looked exceedingly pretty; besides, Ellie could sing, and with so sweet a voice that the like nobody ever had heard.", "One night, as she lay in her nice little bed, an ugly, yellow toad hopped in through the broken window-pane.", "The creature was large and ugly, and jumped right upon the table where Ellie lay asleep under the rose-leaf.", "\u201cWhy that would be a pretty wife for my son,\u201d said the toad; then it seized with its mouth the nutshell in which Ellie was, and hopped with it through the window into the garden.", "Here was a large piece of water, but the banks were marshy; and there the toad and her son lived.", "Faugh!", "how ugly the son was!", "all spotted with green and yellow, just like his mother; and all he had to say when he saw the pretty little maiden in the nutshell was, \u201cCroak!", "Cr-rr-oa-oa-k! Cr-r-r-oak!\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t speak so loud,\u201d said his mother: \u201cIf you do, she may wake up and escape, for she is lighter than swans\u2019 down.", "We will take her out on the river and put her on the leaf of a water-lily; to her that will be a large island; and thence she cannot  escape; and we, meanwhile, will build a festal hall below in the mud, where you two shall live together.\u201d", "Innumerable plants were growing in the water, with their broad green leaves looking as though they floated on the stream.", "The one that grew farthest off was at the same time the largest, and thither the old toad swam, and set the walnut-shell with the little maiden upon it.", "Poor little Ellie awoke early on the following morning; and when she looked about her and saw where she was, that her new dwelling was surrounded with water, and that there was no possible way by which she could get to land, she began to weep bitterly.", "The old toad sat, meanwhile, in the marsh, and decorated the hall with reeds and the leaves of the water-lily, so that it might look nice for her future daughter-in-law; and then, in company with her frightful son, she swam to the island lily-leaf, where Ellie was.", "They wanted to fetch her pretty little bed, that it might at once be  placed in the chamber before Ellie herself came there.", "The old toad bowed most politely to her in the water, at the same time that she introduced her son with the words\u2014\u201cHere you behold my son; he is to be your husband; and you both can live together delightfully down below there in the mud!\u201d", "\u201cCr-oa-oa-oa-k! Cr-oa-oa-oa-k!", "Breckke-kek!\u201d was all the bridegroom could find to say in reply.", "On this they both took the charming little bed and swam away with it; but Ellie sat alone on the leaf and cried, for she could not bear to live with the ugly toad of a mamma, and still less to have her hideous son for a husband.", "The little fishes that swam below in the water had probably seen the toad, and heard what she said; for they put up their heads that they might have a look at the little maiden.", "As soon as they had seen her, they were touched by her beauty, and they were very sorry that such a charming little damsel should become  the prey of a nasty toad.", "They therefore assembled round the green stem on which the leaf grew where Ellie was, and gnawed it in two with their teeth; and now leaf and Ellie, slowly and gently, floated down the stream, far away out of reach of the toad.", "Thus the little maiden sailed along, past towns and villages; and when the birds on the trees perceived her, they sang aloud, \u201cOh, what a charming little maid!\u201d", "But away, away floated the leaf, always further and further; Ellie was making quite a foreign voyage upon it.", "Then there came a small white butterfly, and after fluttering about a long time, settled at last on her leaf, because Ellie pleased him; she, too, was glad of the visit; for she knew it would be impossible for the toad to overtake her now.", "The country she passed through was very beautiful; and the sun shone on the water, making it glitter like gold.", "It now entered her head to take off her girdle, and bind one end of it to the butterfly, and the other to the leaf;  so that it went along much quicker, and she got more expeditiously through the world, and saw a great deal more of its beauties and wonders.", "As she was thus sailing along so charmingly a cockchafer flew by, who laid hold of her thin waist with his long nippers, and flew away with her up into a tree, while the leaf of the water-lily, that was obliged to follow the butterfly, floated on; for Ellie had bound him so firmly that he could not get loose.", "Oh, how frightened was poor Ellie when the cockchafer flew away with her into the tree!", "She was, too, so sorry for the little butterfly, who now would perish, unless he could liberate himself from her girdle and the green leaf.", "But all this did not trouble the chafer; he put her down on a large leaf, gave her honey to eat, which had been gathered from the flowers, and told her she was quite charming, although she was not at all like a chafer.", "Before long all the other cockchafers that  lived in the tree made their appearance, and paid their respects to Ellie, stared at her from head to foot, while the young-lady chafers turned up their feelers and said, \u201cShe has but two legs; and that looks very wretched.", "She has no feelers either,\u201d said they; \u201cand is, moreover, as small round the waist as a human being!", "It\u2019s very ugly, I declare!", "it is really hideous!\u201d", "cried out all the young-lady chafers at once.", "And yet our sweet Ellie was really the most engaging little being imaginable.", "And so the cockchafer that had carried her off thought too; but because all the lady chafers said she was ugly, he began at last to think so himself, and therefore would have nothing more to say to her; she might go where she chose, he said; and with these words he flew with her over the ground, and set her on a daisy.", "The poor thing wept, because she was so ugly that not even a cockchafer would have anything to do with her.", "But, despite the opinion of the young-lady chafers, which was certainly a very important one, Ellie  was the most lovely little creature in the world, as delicate and beautiful as a young rose-leaf.", "All that long summer poor Ellie lived quite alone, in the large forest.", "She wove herself a bed of fine grasses, which she then hung up under a burdock-leaf, that it might not be washed away by the rain.", "For food she gathered the honey from the flower-cups; and she drank the fresh dew that every morning stood in glittering drops upon the leaves.", "Thus passed the summer and autumn; but now came the cold long winter.", "All the birds that had sung so prettily to Ellie forsook her now; the trees lost their foliage, the flowers faded, and the large burdock-leaf, which hitherto had served her for shelter, shrunk together, till nothing but a dry yellow stalk was left, and she was so cold, for her clothes were in rags; and she herself was so delicate and small!", "Poor Ellie shivered; she was almost frozen to death!", "It began, too, to snow, and every flake  that struck her was as much to her as a whole shovel-full would be for us, her whole body being only an inch long.", "To protect herself from the weather, she wrapped herself up in a dead leaf; but there was no warmth in it, and she trembled from head to foot with cold.", "Close to the wood where Ellie lay was a large corn-field; but the corn had long been cut, and only the dried stubble now stood above the ground; but to Ellie this was a wood, and hither she came.", "So she chanced to arrive at the house of a field-mouse, which consisted of a little hole among the roots of the corn-stubble.", "Here, warm and comfortable, dwelt the field-mouse; she had her whole room stored full of corn for the winter; and besides it a nice little kitchen and larder.", "Poor Ellie approached the door like a little beggar child, and prayed for a morsel of barley-corn to eat; for she had tasted nothing for two whole days.", "\u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said the field-mouse, who was very good-hearted; \u201ccome into  my warm room, and eat some of my bread.\u201d", "And as Ellie pleased her, she said, \u201cPerhaps you would like to pass the winter in my house; but then you must keep my room clean, and tell me fairy tales to amuse me; for that is what I like more than any thing.\u201d", "Ellie did what the good mouse required, and in return had a very comfortable life.", "\u201cWe shall soon have visitors,\u201d said the field-mouse to her one day, soon after Ellie was settled in her place.", "\u201cMy neighbor usually pays me a visit once a-week.", "He lives in much grander style than I; for he has many splendid chambers, and wears costly fur.", "If you could get him for a husband, you were then well provided for; however, his sight is not very good.", "But you must not fail to tell him the prettiest stories, and sing for him the most touching songs, that you know.\u201d", "But Ellie would listen to nothing of the sort; for she could not bear the sight of their neighbor, because he was a mole.", "He really did come to pay the mouse a  visit; and, true enough, had on fur as soft as velvet.", "He was very rich and very learned, the field-mouse said; and his house was more than twenty times larger than hers.", "As to his being learned, there was not a doubt about it; but he detested the sun and the gay flowers, and spoke of both with contempt, though he had never seen either.", "Ellie was obliged to sing to him; so she sang two songs, \u201cFly away, lady-bird, fly away home!\u201d", "and \u201cThe priest goes to the field!\u201d", "Her beautiful voice so pleased the mole, that he fell in love with her; but he took good care not to show it; for he was a most sensible personage.", "A short time before, he had made a long passage from his dwelling to that of his neighbor; and he now gave Ellie and the mouse permission to walk in it as often as they pleased.", "He begged them, at the same time, not to be frightened at the dead bird that lay at the entrance.", "It was, no doubt, a bird that had just died; for it had all its feathers on, and seemed to have been  buried at the spot where the mole had built his gallery.", "Neighbor mole then took a bit of touchwood in his mouth, for it shines just like fire in the dark, and went before to light them through the dark passage; and when he came to the spot where the dead bird lay, he gave the earth a push with his snout, so that the mould rolled down and made a large opening, through which the daylight fell.", "Ellie could now see the dead bird quite well\u2014it was a swallow.", "Its pretty wings were pressed close to its body, and its feet and head drawn back under the feathers.", "\u201cThe poor bird is certainly frozen to death,\u201d said Ellie; and she was heartily sorry for the poor animal, for she loved birds dearly, because they had sung to her the whole summer long.", "But the mole gave it a push with his foot, and said, \u201cThere is an end of all his fine singing now!", "It really must be a wretched existence to be a bird!", "Thank heaven, my children won\u2019t be birds.", "Why, such a poor  feathery thing has nothing in the world except his \u2018chirp,\u2019 \u2018chirp,\u2019 and when winter comes he must starve.\u201d", "\u201cYes, indeed, you may well say that, replied the mouse.", "\u201cAnd with all his fine \u2018chirp,\u2019 \u2018chirp.\u2019", "what has a bird got when winter is come?", "Starvation and cold, that\u2019s all?", "But that I suppose is thought very grand.\u201d", "Ellie was silent; but when the others turned their backs, she bent over the bird, put aside the feathers which lay over its head, and kissed its closed eyes.", "\u201cPerhaps it was you who sang me such pretty songs,\u201d thought she.", "\u201cHow often have you delighted me, my dear, beautiful bird!\u201d", "The mole then stopped up the opening again through which the daylight had entered, and escorted the two ladies home.", "But Ellie could not sleep that night.", "She got up out of bed, platted a mat of hay, carried it to where the dead bird was, spread it over him, and covered him up on every side with soft cotton, which she had  found in the field-mouse\u2019s parlor, that he might rest more warmly than on the cold earth.", "\u201cFarewell, pretty little bird,\u201d said she, \u201cfarewell!", "and many thanks for your friendly song last summer, when all the trees were green, and the sun shone down upon us all so warmly!\u201d", "Then she laid her little head on the bosom of the bird, but she was sadly frightened; for it seemed to her as if something moved within.", "It was the heart of the bird, who was not dead, but only lay benumbed, and came to life again when penetrated by the warmth.", "In autumn the swallows fly to warm countries, but when there is a weakling among them, which tarries behind until the winter sets in, it becomes benumbed with the cold, so that it falls to the ground and lies in a torpid state till the chill snow covers it.", "At first Ellie was frightened when the bird began to move, for compared to her he was a giant; but she soon took courage,  tucked in the covering all around the exhausted creature, and then fetched the mint leaf which had hitherto served her as a pillow, in order to put it over the poor bird\u2019s head.", "The following night she again stole away to the swallow, whom she now found quite revived, but still so weak that he could only open his eyes a few times to look at Ellie, who held a bit of touch wood in her hand that she might see his face.", "\u201cA thousand thanks, you pretty little child,\u201d said the sick swallow.", "\u201cI am so warmed through, that I shall soon recover my strength, and be able to fly out again into the warm sunshine.\u201d", "\u201cOh, it is still much too cold out of doors,\u201d answered Ellie.", "\u201cIt snows and freezes still.", "You must stay in your warm bed, and I will nurse you and take care of you.\u201d", "She now brought the bird some water in a leaf, which he drank; and he told her how he had hurt his wings with some brambles so much that he was not able to  fly away to the warm countries with his companions, but had fallen exhausted to the earth, and had lost all power of recollection, so that it did not know how it had come there.", "The little swallow remained here the whole winter, and Ellie tended him and liked him better and better every day; but she told the mole and the field-mouse nothing of the matter, for she knew very well that neither of them could bear the poor bird.", "As soon as summer was come and the genial rays of the sun penetrated the earth, the swallow bade Ellie farewell; for she had opened the hole in the ground through which the mole had let in the light.", "The sun shone so cheerily that the swallow asked his faithful nurse if she would not fly away with him.", "She might sit on his back, and then they would fly away together to the wood.", "But Ellie thought it would grieve the old field-mouse if she were to leave her in secret, and therefore she felt obliged to decline the kind invitation of the swallow.", "\u201cFarewell, then, good little maiden,\u201d said the swallow, and flew off into the pleasant sunshine.", "Ellie looked after him sorrowfully, and tears came into her eyes; for she liked the friendly bird very much, and was sorry to part from him.", "She felt quite forlorn now he was gone.", "\u201cChirup! chirup!", "chirup!\u201d sang the swallow, and flew away toward the green wood.", "Ellie was now very sad, for she was not allowed to go out of the dark hole to enjoy the warm sunshine.", "The corn grew up above her, and formed quite a thick wood before the dwelling of the field-mouse.", "\u201cYou can employ the summer in getting your wedding-clothes ready, and what you want in housekeeping,\u201d said the mouse; for her neighbor, the tiresome mole, had really proposed for Ellie.", "\u201cI will give you all you want, both woollen and linen,\u201d said the mouse, \u201cso that you may have a house full when you are the wife of the mole.\u201d", "So Ellie was obliged to spin at the bobbins,  and the field-mouse hired four spiders that were forced to weave day and night.", "Every evening the mole came to pay a visit, and always spoke of his wish that summer would soon be over, that there might be an end of the heat; and when winter should come, then was to be the wedding.", "But Ellie was not at all glad; for she could not bear the sight of the ugly mole, though his fur was as rich and soft as velvet.", "Morning and evening she stole to the door; and when the breeze blew the ears of corn apart, and she could see the blue sky, she thought it was so beautiful and bright out there in the open air, and she wished with all her heart that she might see the little swallow once again.", "But no swallow came; he was, no doubt, enjoying the warm sunshine far away in the green wood.", "As autumn approached, Ellie was ready with her wedding-things.", "\u201cIn four weeks you will be married,\u201d said the old field-mouse;

and she begged so hard, that the mouse gave her leave to go out and see it for the last time.", "\u201cFarewell, beloved sun!\u201d said she, raising her hands to the sky, and advancing some steps from the house; for the harvest  was over, and the dry stubble again on the field.", "\u201cFarewell! farewell!\u201d repeated she, and twined her arms round a little flower that stood near her.", "Remember me to the swallow if you should chance to see him.\u201d", "\u201cChirrup! chirrup!", "chirrup!\u201d", "resounded at the same moment; and when Ellie lifted up her eyes, she saw the very same well- known swallow fly by.", "As soon as the bird perceived Ellie, he instantly flew to his kind nurse, who told him how unwilling she was to take the ugly mole for her husband; and that she was to live with him under-ground, where the sun and moon would never shine.", "At these words she burst into tears.", "\u201cWinter will soon be here,\u201d said the swallow, \u201cand I shall fly far away to the warm countries.", "If you will travel with me, I will willingly take you on my back.", "You have only to bind yourself on firmly with your girdle, and off we will fly far away from the hateful mole and his dark chamber, over mountain and valley, to  those beautiful lands where the sun shines much more warmly than here; where ceaseless summer reigns, and bright flowers are always blooming.", "Take courage, and fly with me, good little Ellie; you who saved my life when I lay frozen and almost dead on the earth!\u201d", "\u201cYes, I will fly with you,\u201d exclaimed Ellie joyfully.", "She mounted on the back of the swallow, supported her feet on his wings, fastened herself by her girdle to a strong feather, and flew away with him high over woods and lakes, over valley and mountain.", "When they passed over icy or snowy glaciers, Ellie often felt cold; but then she crept under the feathers of the bird, covered herself all over, and only put out her head to admire all the wonders below her.", "At last they arrived in the warm countries.", "There the sun shone brighter than with us; che sky was as high again, and on walls and palings grew the finest blue and green grapes.", "Ripe oranges and citrons hung in the groves, and the fragrance of myrtles  and of jasmine rose in the air, while lovely children played about with the most brilliantly painted butterflies.", "But the swallow flew further and further, and beneath them the country became always more and more beautiful.", "On the banks of a lake, amid magnificent acacias, stood a marble palace, built in long-past days.", "Vines twined themselves round its columns, on which, high above, many swallows\u2019 nests were hanging.", "Into one of these nests the swallow carried Ellie.", "\u201cHere is my home,\u201d said he;

but between each fragment  the most beautiful white flowers grew luxuriantly.", "The swallow flew with Ellie to one of these flowers, and set her down on a broad leaf; but how astonished was Ellie when she saw that in the flower a little mannikin was sitting, as delicate and transparent as glass.", "He wore a small golden crown on his head, and the most beautiful bright wings on his shoulders; and he was not a whit larger than Ellie herself.", "This was the sylph of the flower.", "In each flower dwelt such a little man with his wife; but this was the king of all the sylphs of the flowers.", "\u201cOh, how handsome this king is!\u201d", "whispered Ellie in the swallow\u2019s ear.", "The little prince started at the sudden arrival of the great bird;

and then a lady appeared, and then a gentleman, out of all the other flowers, so lovely, that it was quite a pleasure to see them, and each of them brought a present to Ellie.", "The best gift that was offered her was a pair of beautiful white wings, which were fastened on her shoulders immediately;

copper in the light of the brilliant sun, his body erect and tense in his attitude of defiance, he looked indeed a mortal fit almost to challenge gods.", "The mob, led by the black-robed priests and nobles who had arrived at the foot of the steps, now fell back before the stunning, magnificent defiance of their giant ruler.", "They felt like demons who had assailed the heavens and had been abashed and shamed by the mere sight of that which they had assailed.", "A hush fell over them.", "Their upraised arms faltered and sank down.", "A moment more and they would have fallen to their knees.", "What happened then seemed nothing less than a miracle.", "In his triumph and exultation, the pharaoh had been careless of the crum-bling edges of the steps.", "Centuries old, there were sections of these steps which were falling apart.", "Upon such a section had the gold-sandaled foot of the pharaoh descended, and it was not strong enough to sustain his great weight.", "With a scuttling sound it broke loose.", "A gasp came from the mob\u2014the pharaoh was about to fall.", "He was palpitating, wavering in the air, fighting to retain his balance.", "He looked as if he were grappling with some monstrous, invisible snake, coiled about his gleaming body.", "A hoarse cry burst from his lips; his sword fell; and then his body thudded down the steps in a series of wild

elaborate ceremony of coronation had been concluded, she responded to the cheers of the multitude with a smile which could not have appeared more amicable and gracious.", "None might know from that

after the beauteous Nitocris mounted the golden throne of Egypt, rumors were whispered of some vast, mysterious enterprise being conducted in secret.", "A large number of slaves were observed each dawn to embark upon barges and to be carried down the river to some unknown point, where they labored throughout the day, returning after dark.", "The slaves were Ethiopians, neither able to speak nor to understand the Egyptian language, and therefore no information could be gotten from them by the curious as to the object of their mysterious daily excursions.", "The general opinion though, was that the pious queen was having a great temple constructed to the gods and that when it was finished, enormous public banquets would be held within it before its dedication.", "She meant it to be a surprise gift to the priests who were ever desirous of some new place of worship and were dissatisfied with their old altars, which they said were defiled.", "Throughout the winter the slaves repeated daily their excursions.", "Traffic of all kinds plying down the river was restricted for several miles to within forty yards of one shore.", "Any craft seen to disregard that restriction was set upon by a galley of armed men and pursued back into bounds.", "All that could be learned was that a prodigious temple or hall of some sort was in construction.", "It was late in the spring when the excursions of the workmen were finally discontinued.", "Restrictions upon river traffic were withdrawn.", "The men who went eagerly to investigate the mysterious construction returned with tales of a magnificent new temple, surrounded by rich green, tropical verdure, situated near the bank of the river.", "It was temple to the god Osiris.", "It had been built by the queen probably that she might partly atone for the sacrilege of her brother and deliver him from some of the torture which he undoubtedly suffered.", "It was to be dedicated within the month by a great banquet.", "All the nobles

passed through the streets in her open litter, bedazzling eyes by the glitter of her golden ornaments, the cries of the people were almost frantic in their exaltation of her.", "True to the predictions of the gossipers, before the month had passed the banquet had been formally announced and to all the nobility and the priests of Osiris had been issued invitations to attend.", "The day of the dedication, which was to be followed by the night of banqueting, was a gala holiday.", "At noon the guests of the empress formed a colorful assembly upon the bank of the river.", "Gaily draped barges floated at their moorings until preparations should be com-pleted for the transportation of the guests to the temple.", "All anticipated a holiday of great merriment, and the lustful epicureans were warmed by visualizations of the delightful banquet of copious meats, fruits, luscious delicacies and other less innocent indulgences.", "When the queen arrived, clamorous shouts rang deafeningly in her ears.", "She responded with charming smiles and gracious bows.", "The most discerning observer could not have detected anything but the greatest cordiality and kindliness reflected in her bearing toward those around her.", "No action, no fleeting expression upon her lovely face could have caused anyone to suspect anything except entire amicability in her feelings or her intentions.",

were the guests of the empress as they followed her in gayly draped barges, singing and laughing down the sun-glowing waters of the Nile.", "The most vivid descriptions of those who had already seen the temple did not prepare the others for the spectacle of beauty and grandeur which it presented.", "Gasps of delight came from the priests.", "What a place in which to conduct their ceremonies!",

massive and painted with the greatest artistry.", "The temple itself was proportionately large.", "The center of it was unroofed.", "Above the entrance were carved the various symbols of the god Osiris, with splendid workmanship.", "The building was immensely big, and against the background of green foliage it presented a picture of almost breathtaking beauty.", "Ethiopian attendants stood on each side of the doorway, their shining black bodies ornamented with bands of brilliant gold.", "On the interior the guests were inspired to even greater wonderment.", "The walls were hung with magnificent painted tapes-tries.", "The altars were more beautifully and elaborately carved than any seen before.", "Aromatic powders were burning upon them and sending up veils of scented smoke.", "The sacramental vessels were of the most exquisite and costly metals.", "Golden coffers and urns were piled high with perfect fruits of all kinds.", "Ah, yes\u2014a splendid place for the making of sacrifices, gloated the staring priests.", "Ah, yes indeed, agreed the queen Nitocris, smiling with half-crossed eyes, it was a splendid place for sacrifices\u2014especially for the human sacrifice that had been planned.", "But all who observed that guileful smile interpreted it as gratification over the pleasure which her crea-tion in honor of their god had brought to the priests of Osiris.", "Not the slightest shadow of portent was upon the hearts of the joyous guests.", "The ceremony of dedication occupied the whole of the afternoon.", "And when it drew to its impressive conclusion, the large assembly, their nostrils quivering from the savory odor of the roasting meats, were fully ready and impatient for the banquet that awaited them.", "They gazed about them, observing that the whole building composed an unpartitioned amphitheater and wondering where might be the room of the banquet.", "However, when the concluding processional chant had been completed the queen summoned a number of burly slaves, and by several iron rings attached to its outer edge they lifted up a large slab of the flooring, disclosing to the astonished guests the fact that the scene of the banquet was to be an immense subterranean vault.", "Such vaults were decidedly uncommon among the Egyptians.", "The idea of feasting in one was novel and appealing.", "Thrilled exclamations came from the eager, excited crowd and they pressed forward to gaze into the depths, now brightly illuminated.", "They saw a room beneath them almost as vast in size as the amphitheater in which they were standing.", "It was filled with banquet tables upon which were set the most delectable foods and rich, sparkling wines in an abundance that would satiate the banqueters of Bacchus.", "Luxurious, thick rugs covered the floors.", "Among the tables passed nymphlike maidens, and at one end of the room harpists and singers stood, making sublime music.", "The air was cool with the dampness of under-earth, and it was made delightfully fragrant by the perfumes of burning spices and the savory odors of the feast.", "If it had been heaven itself which the crowd of the queen's guests now gazed down upon they would not have considered the vision disappointing.", "Perhaps even if they had known the hideous menace that lurked in those gay-draped walls beneath them, they would still have found the allurement of the banquet scene difficult to resist.", "Decorum and reserve were almost completely forgotten in the swift-ness of the guests' descent.", "The stairs were not wide enough to afford room for all those who rushed upon them, and some tumbled over, landing unhurt upon the thick carpets.", "The priests themselves forgot their customary dignity and aloofness when they looked upon the beauty of the maiden attendants.", "Immediately all of the guests gathered around the banquet tables, and the next hour was occupied in gluttonous feasting.", "Wine was unlimited, and so was the thirst of the guests.", "Goblets were refilled as quickly as they were made empty by the capacious mouths of the drinkers.", "The songs and the laughter, the dancing and the wild frolick-ing grew less and less restrained until the banquet became a delirious orgy.", "The queen alone, seated upon a cushioned dais from which she might overlook the whole room, remained aloof from the general hilarity.", "Her thick black brows twitched; her luminous black eyes shone strangely between their narrow painted lids.", "There was something peculiarly feline in the curl of her rich red lips.", "Now and again her eyes sought the section of wall to her left, where hung gorgeous braided tapestries from the east.", "But it seemed not the tapestries that she looked upon.", "Color would mount upon her brow and her slender fingers would dig still tighter into the cushions she reclined upon.", "In her mind the queen Nitocris was seeing a ghastly picture.", "It was the picture of a room of orgy and feasting suddenly converted into a room of terror and horror, human beings one moment drunken and lustful, the next screaming in the seizure of sudden and awful death.", "If any of those present had been empowered to see also that picture of dire horror, they would have clambered wildly to make their escape.", "But none was so empowered.", "With increasing wildness the banquet continued into the middle of the night.", "Some of the banqueters, disgustingly gluttonous, still gorged themselves at the greasy tables.", "Others lay in drunken stupor, or lolled amorously with the slave girls.", "But most of them, formed in a great irregular circle, skipped about the room in a barbaric, joy-mad dance, dragging and tripping each other in uncouth merriment and making the hall ring with their ceaseless shouts, laughter, and hoarse song.", "When the hour had approached near to midnight, the queen, who had sat like one entranced, arose from the cushioned dais.", "One last intent survey she gave to the crowded room of banquet.", "It was a scene which she wished to imprint permanently upon her mind.", "Much plea-sure might she derive in the future by recalling that picture, and then imagining what came afterward\u2014stark, searing terror rushing in upon barbaric joy!", "She stepped down from the dais and walked swiftly to the steps.", "Her departure made no impression upon the revelers.", "When she had ar-rived at the top of the stairs she looked down and observed that no one had marked her exit.", "Around the walls of the temple, dim-lit and fantastic-looking at night, with the cool wind from the river sweeping through and bending the flames of the tall candelabra, stalwart guardsmen were standing at their posts, and when the gold cloaked figure of the queen arose from the aperture, they advanced toward her hurriedly.", "With a motion, she directed them to place the slab of rock in its tight-fitting sockets.", "With a swift, noiseless hoist and lowering, they obeyed the command.", "The queen bent down.", "There was no change in the boisterous sounds from below.", "Nothing was yet suspected.", "Drawing the soft and shimmering folds of her cloak about her with fingers that trembled with eagerness, excitement and the intense emo-tion which she felt, the queen passed swiftly across the stone floor of the temple toward the open front through which the night wind swept, blowing her cloak in sheenful waves about her tall and graceful figure.", "The slaves followed after in silent file, well aware of the monstrous deed about to be executed and without reluctance to play their parts.", "Down the steps of the palace into the moon-white night, passed the weird procession.", "Their way led them down an obviously secreted path through thick ranks of murmuring palms which in their low voices seemed to be whispering shocked remonstrances against what was about to be done.", "But in her stern purpose the queen was not suscepti-ble to any dissuasion from god or man.", "Vengeance, strongest of pas-sions, made her obdurate as stone.", "Out upon a rough and apparently new-constructed stone pier the thin path led.", "Beneath, the cold, dark waters of the Nile surged silently by.", "Here the party came to a halt.", "Upon this stone pier would the object of their awful midnight errand be accomplished.", "With a low-spoken word, the queen commanded her followers to hold back.", "With her own hand she would perform the act of vengeance.", "In the foreground of the pier a number of fantastic, wandlike levers extended upward.", "Toward these the queen advanced, slowly and stiffly as an executioner mounts the steps of the scaffold.", "When she had come beside them, she grasped one up thrust bar, fiercely, as if it had been the throat of a hated antagonist.", "Then she lifted her face with a quick intake of breath toward the moon-lightened sky.", "This was to her a moment of supreme ecstasy.", "Grasped in her hand was an instrument which could release awful death upon those against whom she wished vengeance.", "Their lives were as securely in her grasp as was this bar of iron.", "Slowly, lusting upon every triumph-filled second of this time of ecstasy, she turned her face down again to the formidable bar in her hand.", "Deliberately she drew it back to its limit.", "This was the lever that opened the wall in the banquet vault.", "It gave entrance to death.", "Only the other bar now intervened between the banqueters, probably still reveling undisturbed, and the dreadful fate which she had prepared for them.", "Upon this bar now her jeweled fingers clutched.", "Savagely this time she pulled it; then with the litheness of a tiger she sprang to the edge of the pier.", "She leaned over it and stared down into the inky rush of the river.", "A new sound she heard above the steady flow.", "It was the sound of waters suddenly diverted into a new channel\u2014an eager, plunging sound.", "Down to the hall of revelry they were rushing\u2014these savage waters\u2014bringing terror and sudden death.", "A cry of triumph, wild and terrible enough to make even the hearts of the brutish slaves turn cold, now broke from the lips of the queen.", "The pharaoh was avenged.", "And even he must have considered his avenging adequate had he been able to witness it.", "After the retiring of the queen, the banquet had gone on without interruption of gayety.", "None noticed her absence.", "None noticed the silent replacing of the stone in the socket.", "No premonition of disaster was felt.", "The musicians, having been informed beforehand of the intended event of the evening, had made their withdrawal before the queen.", "The slaves, whose lives were of little value to the queen, were as ignorant of what was to happen as were the guests themselves.", "Not until the wall opened up, with a loud and startling crunch, did even those most inclined toward suspicion feel the slightest uneasiness.", "Then it was that a few noticed the slab to have been replaced, shutting them in.", "This discovery, communicated throughout the hall in a mo-ment, seemed to instill a sudden fear in the hearts of all.", "Laughter did not cease, but the ring of dancers were distracted from their wild jubilee.", "They all turned toward the mysteriously opened wall and gazed into its black depths.", "A hush fell over them.", "And then became audible the mounting sound of rushing water.", "A shriek rose from the throat of a woman.", "And then terror took possession of all within the room.", "Panic like the burst of flames flared into their hearts.", "Of one accord, they rushed upon the stair.", "And it, being purposely made frail, collapsed before the foremost of the wildly screaming mob had reached its summit.", "Turbulently they piled over the tables, filling the room with a hideous clamor.", "But rising above their screams was the shrill roar of the rushing water, and no sound could be more provoking of dread and terror.", "Somewhere in its circuitous route from the pier to the chamber of its reception it must have met with temporary blockade, for it was several minutes after the sound of it was first detected that the first spray of that death-bringing water leapt into the faces of the doomed occupants of the room.", "With the ferocity of a lion springing into the arena of a Roman amphitheater to devour the gladiators set there for its delectation, the black water plunged in.", "Furiously it surged over the floor of the room, sweeping tables before it and sending its victims, now face to face with their harrowing doom, into a hysteria of terror.", "In a moment that icy, black water had risen to their knees, although the room was vast.", "Some fell instantly dead from the shock, or were trampled upon by the desperate rushing of the mob.", "Tables were clambered upon.", "Lamps and candles were extinguished.", "Brilliant light rapidly faded to twilight, and a ghastly dimness fell over the room as only the suspended lanterns remained lit.", "And what a scene of chaotic and hideous horror might a spectator have beheld!", "The gorgeous trumpery of banquet invaded by howling waters of death!", "Gaily dressed merrymakers caught suddenly in the grip of terror!", "Gasps and screams of the dying amid tumult and thickening dark!", "What more horrible vengeance could Queen Nitocris have conceived than this banquet of death?", "Not Diablo himself could be capable of anything more fiendishly artistic.", "Here in the temple of Osiris those nobles and priests who had slain the pharaoh in expiation of his sacrilege against Osiris had now met their deaths.", "And it was in the waters of the Nile, material symbol of the god Osiris, that they had died.", "It was magnificent in its irony!", "I would be content to end this story here if it were but a story.", "However, it is not merely a story, as you will have discerned before now if you have been a student of the history of Egypt.", "Queen Nitocris is not a fictitious personage.", "In the annals of ancient Egypt she is no inconspicuous figure.", "Principally responsible for her prominence is her monstrous revenge upon the slayers of her brother, the narration of which I have just concluded.", "Glad would I be to end this story here; for surely anything following must be in the nature of an anticlimax.", "However, being not a mere storyteller here, but having upon me also the responsibility of a historian, I feel obliged to continue the account to the point where it was left off by Herodotus, the great Greek historian.", "And therefore I add this postscript, anticlimax though it be.", "The morning of the day after the massacre in the temple, the guests of the queen not having made their return, the citizens of Thebes began to glower with dark suspicions.", "Rumors came to them through divers channels that something of a most extraordinary and calamitous nature had occurred at the scene of the banquet during the night.", "Some had it that the temple had collapsed upon the revelers and all had been killed.", "However, this theory was speedily dispelled when a voyager from down the river reported having passed the temple in a perfectly firm condition but declared that he had seen no signs of life about the place\u2014only the brightly canopied boats, drifting at their moorings.", "Uneasiness steadily increased throughout the day.", "Sage persons recalled the great devotion of the queen toward her dead brother, and noted that the guests at the banquet of last night had been composed almost entirely of those who had participated in his slaying.", "When in the evening the queen arrived in the city, pale, silent, and obviously nervous, threatening crowds blocked the path of her chariot, demanding roughly an explanation of the disappearance of her guests.", "Haughtily she ignored them and lashed forward the horses of her chariot, pushing aside the tight mass of people.", "Well she knew, how-ever, that her life would be doomed as soon as they confirmed their suspicions.", "She resolved to meet her inevitable death in a way that befitted one of her rank, not at the filthy hands of a mob.", "Therefore upon her entrance into the palace she ordered her slaves to fill instantly her boudoir with hot and smoking ashes.", "When this had been done, she went to the room, entered it, closed the door and locked it securely, and then flung herself down upon a couch in the center of the room.", "In a short time the scorching heat and the suffocating thick

hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains for means to reach it.", "There was nothing like a ladder in the tomb, and the coffin niches on the sides and rear\u2014which Birch seldom took the trouble to use\u2014afforded no ascent to the space above the door.", "Only the coffins themselves remained as potential stepping-stones, and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of transporting them.", "Three coffin-heights, he reckoned, would permit him to reach the transom;

for the unexpected tenacity of the easy-looking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes, and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus.", "Dusk fell and found Birch still toiling.", "He worked largely by feeling now, since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture.", "He could, he was sure, get out by midnight\u2014though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications.", "Undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time, the place, and the company beneath his feet, he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing when a fragment hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree.", "In time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked.", "He would not, he found, have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height; for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit.", "It must have been midnight at least when Birch decided he could get through the transom.", "Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside.", "The hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily, and he vaguely wished it would stop.", "He was curiously unelated over his impending escape, and almost dreaded the exertion, for his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age.", "As he remounted the splitting coffins he felt his weight very poignantly; especially when, upon reaching the topmost one, he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood.", "He had, it seems, planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform; for no sooner was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way, jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine.", "Maddened by the sound, or by the stench which billowed forth even to the open air, the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh, and plunged madly off through the night, the wagon rattling crazily behind it.", "Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined try.", "Clutching the edges of the aperture, he sought to pull himself up, when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on both his ankles.", "In another moment he knew fear for the first time that night; for struggle as he would, he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity.", "Horrible pains, as of savage wounds, shot through his calves; and in his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggested splinters, loose nails, or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box.", "Perhaps he screamed.", "At any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost eclipsed in a half-swoon.", "Instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom, and in the crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground.", "He could not walk, it appeared, and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge; his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste, and his body responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare.", "There was evidently, however, no pursuer; for he was alone and alive when Armington, the lodge-keeper, answered his feeble clawing at the door.", "Armington helped Birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son Edwin for Dr. Davis.", "The afflicted man was fully conscious, but would say nothing of any consequence; merely muttering such things as \"Oh, my ankles!\", \"Let go!\", or \"Shut in the tomb\".", "Then the doctor came with his medicine-case and asked crisp questions, and removed the patient's outer clothing, shoes, and socks.", "The wounds\u2014for both ankles were frightfully lacerated about the Achilles' tendons\u2014seemed to puzzle the old physician greatly, and finally almost to frighten him.", "His questioning grew more than medically tense, and his hands shook as he dressed the mangled members; binding them as if he wished to get the wounds out of sight as quickly as possible.", "For an impersonal doctor, Davis' ominous and awestruck cross-examination became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker every least detail of his horrible experience.", "He was oddly anxious to know if Birch were sure\u2014absolutely sure\u2014of the identity of that top coffin of the pile; how he had chosen it, how he had been certain of it as the Fenner coffin in the dusk, and how he had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious Asaph Sawyer.", "Would the firm Fenner casket have caved in so readily?", "Davis, an old-time village practitioner, had of course seen both at the respective funerals, as indeed he had attended both Fenner and Sawyer in their last illnesses.", "He had even wondered, at Sawyer's funeral, how the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box so closely akin to that of the diminutive Fenner.", "After a full two hours Dr. Davis left, urging Birch to insist at all times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood.", "What else, he added, could ever in any case be proved or believed?", "But it would be well to say as little as could be said, and to let no other doctor treat the wounds.", "Birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story;

they must often dream.", "It was to a time-battered edifice of this description that I was driven one afternoon in November, 1896, by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure.", "I had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the Miskatonic Valley in quest of certain genealogical data; and from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of my course, had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season.", "Now I found myself upon an apparently abandoned road which I had chosen as the shortest cut to Arkham, overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town, and confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill.", "Distant though it is from the remnant of a road, this house none the less impressed me unfavorably the very moment I espied it.", "Honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before which biased me against places of this kind.", "Yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive.", "I had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as I approached it I was not so sure, for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds, they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion.", "Therefore instead of trying the door I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain.", "As I waited on the rough, mossy rock which served as a door-step, I glanced at the neighboring windows and the panes of the transom above me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost opaque with dirt, they were not broken.", "The building, then, must still be inhabited, despite its isolation and general neglect.", "However, my rapping evoked no response, so after repeating the summons I tried the rusty latch and found the door unfastened.", "Inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling, and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odor.", "I entered, carrying my bicycle, and closed the door behind me.", "Ahead rose a narrow staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar, while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor.", "Leaning my cycle against the wall I opened the door at the left, and crossed into a small low-ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way.", "It appeared to be a kind of sitting-room, for it had a table and several chairs, and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique clock on a mantel.", "Books and papers were very few, and in the prevailing gloom I could not readily discern the titles.", "What interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every visible detail.", "Most of the houses in this region I had found rich in relics of the past, but here the antiquity was curiously complete; for in all the room I could not discover a single article of definitely post-revolutionary date.", "Had the furnishings been less humble, the place would have been a collector's paradise.", "As I surveyed this quaint apartment, I felt an increase in that aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house.", "Just what it was that I feared or loathed, I could by no means define; but something in the whole atmosphere seemed redolent of unhallowed age, of unpleasant crudeness, and of secrets which should be forgotten.", "I felt disinclined to sit down, and wandered about examining the various articles which I had noticed.", "The first object of my curiosity was a book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an antediluvian aspect that I marvelled at beholding it outside a museum or library.", "It was bound in leather with metal fittings, and was in an excellent state of preservation; being altogether an unusual sort of volume to encounter in an abode so lowly.", "When I opened it to the title page my wonder grew even greater, for it proved to be nothing less rare than Pigafetta's account of the Congo region, written in Latin from the notes of the sailor Lopex and printed at Frankfurt in 1598.", "I had often heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers De Bry, hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me.", "The engravings were indeed interesting, drawn wholly from imagination and careless descriptions, and represented negroes with white skins and Caucasian features; nor would I soon have closed the book had not an exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired nerves and revived my sensation of disquiet.", "What annoyed me was merely the persistent way in which the volume tended to fall open of itself at Plate XII, which represented in gruesome detail a butcher's shop of the cannibal Anziques.", "I experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so slight a thing, but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me, especially in connection with some adjacent passages descriptive of Anzique gastronomy.", "I had turned to a neighboring shelf and was examining its meagre literary contents\u2014an eighteenth century Bible, a \"Pilgrim's Progress\" of like period, illustrated with grotesque woodcuts and printed by the almanack-maker Isaiah Thomas, the rotting bulk of Cotton Mather's \"Magnalia Christi Americana,\" and a few other books of evidently equal age\u2014when my attention was aroused by the unmistakable sound of walking in the room overhead.", "At first astonished and startled, considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door, I immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from a sound sleep, and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded on the creaking stairs.", "The tread was heavy, yet seemed to contain a curious quality of cautiousness; a quality which I disliked the more because the tread was heavy.", "When I had entered the room I had shut the door behind me.", "Now, after a moment of silence during which the walker may have been inspecting my bicycle in the hall, I heard a fumbling at the latch and saw the paneled portal swing open again.", "In the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that I should have exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding.", "Old, white-bearded, and ragged, my host possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal wonder and respect.", "His height could not have been less than six feet, and despite a general air of age and poverty he was stout and powerful in proportion.", "His face, almost hidden by a long beard which grew high on the cheeks, seemed abnormally ruddy and less wrinkled than one might expect; while over a high forehead fell a shock of white hair little thinned by the years.", "His blue eyes, though a trifle bloodshot, seemed inexplicably keen and burning.", "But for his horrible unkemptness the man would have been as distinguished-looking as he was impressive.", "This unkemptness, however, made him offensive despite his face and figure.", "Of what his clothing consisted I could hardly tell, for it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters surmounting a pair of high, heavy boots; and his lack of cleanliness surpassed description.", "The appearance of this man, and the instinctive fear he inspired, prepared me for something like enmity; so that I almost shuddered through surprise and a sense of uncanny incongruity when he motioned me to a chair and addressed me in a thin, weak voice full of fawning respect and ingratiating hospitality.", "His speech was very curious, an extreme form of Yankee dialect I had thought long extinct; and I studied it closely as he sat down opposite me for conversation.", "\"Ketched in the rain, be ye?\" he greeted.", "\"Glad ye was nigh the haouse en' hed the sense ta come right in.", "I calc'late", "I was asleep, else I'd a heerd ye\u2014I ain't as young as I uster be, an' I need a paowerful sight o' naps naowadays.", "Trav'lin fur?", "I hain't seed many folks 'long this rud", "sence they tuk off the Arkham stage.\"", "I replied that I was going to Arkham, and apologized for my rude entry into his domicile, whereupon he continued.", "\"Glad ta see ye, young Sir\u2014new faces is scurce arount here, an' I hain't got much ta cheer me up these days.", "Guess yew hail from Bosting, don't ye?", "I never ben thar, but I kin tell a taown man when I see 'im\u2014we hed one fer deestrick schoolmaster in 'eighty-four, but he quit suddent an' no one never heerd on 'im sence\u2014\" here the old man lapsed into a kind of chuckle, and made no explanation when I questioned him.", "He seemed to be in an aboundingly good humor, yet to possess those eccentricities which one might guess from his grooming.", "For some time he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality, when it struck me to ask him how he came by so rare a book as Pigafetta's \"Regnum Congo.\"", "The effect of this volume had not left me, and I felt a certain hesitancy in speaking of it, but curiosity overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the house.", "To my relief, the question did not seem an awkward one, for the old man answered freely and volubly.", "\"Oh, that Afriky book?", "Cap'n Ebenezer Holt traded me thet in 'sixty-eight\u2014him as was kilt in the war.\"", "Something about the name of Ebenezer Holt caused me to look up sharply.", "I had encountered it in my genealogical work, but not in any record since the Revolution.", "I wondered if my host could help me in the task at which I was laboring, and resolved to ask him about it later on.", "He continued.", "\"Ebenezer was on a Salem merchantman for years, an' picked up a sight o' queer stuff in every port.", "He got this in London, I guess\u2014he uster like ter buy things at the shops.", "I was up ta his haouse onct, on the hill, tradin' hosses, when I see this book.", "I relished the picters, so he give it in on a swap.", "'Tis a queer book\u2014here, leave me git on my spectacles\u2014\" The old man fumbled among his rags, producing a pair of dirty and amazingly antique glasses with small octagonal lenses and steel bows.", "Donning these, he reached for the volume on the table and turned the pages lovingly.", "\"Ebenezer cud read a leetle o' this\u2014'tis Latin\u2014but I can't.", "I had two er three schoolmasters read me a bit, and Passon Clark, him they say got draownded in the pond\u2014kin yew make anything outen it?\"", "I told him that I could, and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the beginning.", "If I erred, he was not scholar enough to correct me; for he seemed childishly pleased at my English version.", "His proximity was becoming rather obnoxious, yet I saw no way to escape without offending him.", "I was amused at the childish fondness of this ignorant old man for the pictures in a book he could not read, and wondered how much better he could read the few books in English which adorned the room.", "This revelation of simplicity removed much of the ill-defined apprehension I had felt, and I smiled as my host rambled on: \"Queer haow picters kin set a body thinkin'.", "Take this un here near the front.", "Hey yew ever seed trees like thet, with big leaves a floppin' over an' daown?", "And them men\u2014them can't be

like this un.\"", "Here he pointed to a fabulous creature of the artist, which one might describe as a sort of dragon with the head of an alligator.", "\"But naow I'll show ye the best un\u2014over here nigh the middle\u2014\"The old man's speech grew a trifle thicker and his eyes assumed a brighter glow; but his fumbling hands, though seemingly clumsier than before, were entirely adequate to their mission.", "The book fell open, almost of its own accord and as if from frequent consultation at this place, to the repellent twelfth plate showing a butcher's shop amongst the Anzique cannibals.", "My sense of restlessness returned, though I did not exhibit it.", "The especially bizarre thing was that the artist had made his Africans look like white men\u2014the limbs and quarters hanging about the walls of the shop were ghastly, while the butcher with his axe was hideously incongruous.", "But my host seemed to relish the view as much as I disliked it.", "\"What d'ye think o' this\u2014ain't never see the like hereabouts, eh?", "When I see this I telled Eb Holt, 'That's suthin' ta stir ye up an' make yer blood tickle.'", "When I read in Scripter about slayin'\u2014like

one arm side of it, an' t'other arm's on the other side", "o' the meat block.\"", "As the man mumbled on in his shocking ecstasy the expression on his hairy, spectacled face became indescribable, but his voice sank rather than mounted.", "My own sensations can scarcely be recorded.", "All the terror I had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly, and I knew that I loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me with an infinite intensity.", "His madness, or at least his partial perversion, seemed beyond dispute.", "He was almost whispering now, with a huskiness more terrible than a scream, and I trembled as I listened.", "\"As I says, 'tis queer haow picters sets ye thinkin'.", "D'ye know, young Sir, I'm right sot on this un here.", "Arter I got the book off", "Eb I uster

afore I kilt the sheep for market\u2014killin' sheep was kinder more fun arter lookin' at it\u2014\" The tone of the old man now sank very low, sometimes becoming so faint that his words were hardly audible.", "I listened to the rain, and to the rattling of the bleared, small-paned windows, and marked a rumbling of approaching thunder quite unusual for the season.", "Once a terrific flash and peal shook the frail house to its foundations, but the whisperer seemed not to notice it.", "\"Killin' sheep was kinder more fun\u2014but d'ye know, 'twan't quite satisfyin'.", "Queer haow a cravin'

ef 'twas more the same\u2014\" But the whisperer never continued.", "The interruption was not produced by my fright, nor by the rapidly increasing storm amidst whose fury I was presently to open my eyes on a smoky solitude of blackened ruins.", "It was produced by a very simple though somewhat unusual happening.", "The open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively upward.", "As the old man whispered the words \"more the same\" a tiny splattering impact was heard, and something showed on the yellowed paper of the upturned volume.", "I thought of the rain and of a leaky roof, but rain is not red.", "On the butcher's shop of the Anzique cannibals a small red spattering glistened picturesquely, lending vividness to the horror of the engraving.", "The old man saw it, and stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it necessary; saw it and glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he had left an hour before.", "I followed his glance, and beheld just above us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot of wet crimson which seemed to spread even as I viewed it.", "I did not shriek or move, but merely shut my eyes.", "A moment later came the titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts; blasting that accursed house of unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my mind"], "bn_03520917n": ["Of the events which took place at the Norton Mine on October eighteenth and nineteenth, 1894, I have no desire to speak.", "A sense of duty to science is all that impels me to recall, in the last years of my life, scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because I cannot wholly define it.", "But I believe that before I die I should tell what I know of the\u2014shall I say transition\u2014of Juan Romero.", "My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy it is better that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates to the States or the Colonies, he leaves his past behind him.", "Besides, what I once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative; save perhaps the fact that during my service in India I was more at home amongst white-bearded native teachers than amongst my brother-officers.", "I had delved not a little into odd Eastern lore when overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in America\u2019s vast West\u2014a life wherein I found it well to accept a name\u2014my present one\u2014which is very common and carries no meaning.", "In the summer and autumn of 1894 I dwelt in the drear expanses of the Cactus Mountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated Norton Mine, whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething cauldron of sordid life.", "A cavern of gold, lying deep beneath a mountain lake, had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest dreams, and now formed the seat of extensive tunneling operations on the part of the corporation to which it had finally been sold.", "Additional grottoes had been found, and the yield of yellow metal was exceedingly great; so that a mighty and heterogeneous army of miners toiled day and night in the numerous passages and rock hollows.", "The Superintendent, a Mr. Arthur, often discussed the singularity of the local geological formations; speculating on the probable extent of the chain of caves, and estimating the future of the titanic mining enterprises.", "He considered the auriferous cavities the result of the action of water, and believed the last of them would soon be opened.", "It was not long after my arrival and employment that Juan Romero came to the Norton Mine.", "One of the large herd of unkempt Mexicans attracted thither from the neighbouring country, he at first attracted attention only because of his features; which though plainly of the Red Indian type, were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined conformation, being vastly unlike those of the average \"greaser\" or Piute of the locality.", "It is curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of Hispanicised and tribal Indians, Romero gave not the least impression of Caucasian blood.", "It was not the Castilian conquistador or the American pioneer, but the ancient and noble Aztec, whom imagination called to view when the silent peon would rise in the early morning and gaze in fascination at the sun as it crept above the eastern hills, meanwhile stretching out his arms to the orb as if in the performance of some rite whose nature he did not himself comprehend.", "But save for his face, Romero was not in any way suggestive of nobility.", "Ignorant and dirty, he was at home amongst the other brown-skinned Mexicans; having come (so I was afterward told) from the very lowest sort of surroundings.", "He had been found as a child in a crude mountain hut, the only survivor of an epidemic which had stalked lethally by.", "Near the hut, close to a rather unusual rock fissure, had lain two skeletons, newly picked by vultures, and presumably forming the sole remains of his parents.", "No one recalled their identity, and they were soon forgotten by the many.", "Indeed, the crumbling of the adobe hut and the closing of the rock-fissure by a subsequent avalanche had helped to efface even the scene from recollection.", "Reared by a Mexican cattle-thief who had given him his name, Juan differed little from his fellows.", "The attachment which Romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly commenced through the quaint and ancient Hindoo ring which I wore when not engaged in active labour.", "Of its nature, and manner of coming into my possession, I cannot speak.", "It was my last link with a chapter of my life forever closed, and I valued it highly.", "Soon I observed that the odd-looking Mexican was likewise interested; eyeing it with an expression that banished all suspicion of mere covetousness.", "Its hoary hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection in his untutored but active mind, though he could not possibly have beheld their like before.", "Within a few weeks after his advent, Romero was like a faithful servant to me; this notwithstanding the fact that I was myself but an ordinary miner.", "Our conversation was necessarily limited.", "He knew but a few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain.", "The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions.", "Though the man Romero had interested me, and though my ring had affected him peculiarly, I think that neither of us had any expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off.", "Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite.", "With this work Romero and I were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others.", "The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire mountain.", "Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock, whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet.", "Jewel Lake, which lay above the scene of action, heaved as in a tempest.", "Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate it.", "Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered.", "Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of their failure.", "Firmly though respectfully, they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed.", "Something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them, for so far as they could ascertain, the void below was infinite.", "The Superintendent did not reproach them.", "Instead, he pondered deeply, and made plans for the following day.", "The night shift did not go on that evening.", "At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally.", "From somewhere within the works a dog barked an answer; either to the coyote\u2014or to something else.", "A storm was gathering around the peaks of the range, and weirdly shaped clouds scudded horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous moon\u2019s attempts to shine through many layers of cirro-stratus vapours.", "It was Romero\u2019s voice, coming from the bunk above, that awakened me, a voice excited and tense with some vague expectation I could not understand:  \"Madre de Dios!\u2014el sonido\u2014ese sonido\u2014oiga Vd!\u2014lo oye Vd?\u2014se\u00f1or, THAT SOUND!\"", "I listened, wondering what sound he meant.", "The coyote, the dog, the storm, all were audible; the last named now gaining ascendancy as the wind shrieked more and more frantically.", "Flashes of lightning were visible through the bunk-house window.", "I questioned the nervous Mexican, repeating the sounds I had heard:  \"El coyote\u2014el perro\u2014el viento?\"", "But Romero did not reply.", "Then he commenced whispering as in awe:  \"El ritmo, se\u00f1or\u2014el ritmo de la tierra\u2014THAT THROB DOWN IN THE GROUND!\"", "And now I also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why.", "Deep, deep, below me was a sound\u2014a rhythm, just as the peon had said\u2014which, though exceedingly faint, yet dominated even the dog, the coyote, and the increasing tempest.", "To seek to describe it was useless\u2014for it was such that no description is possible.", "Perhaps it was like the pulsing of the engines far down in a great liner, as sensed from the deck, yet it was not so mechanical; not so devoid of the element of the life and consciousness.", "Of all its qualities, remoteness in the earth most impressed me.", "To my mind rushed fragments of a passage in Joseph Glanvil which Poe has quoted with tremendous effect:Motto of A Descent into the Maelstrom \".\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.", "the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.\"", "Suddenly Romero leaped from his bunk, pausing before me to gaze at the strange ring on my hand, which glistened queerly in every flash of lightning, and then staring intently in the direction of the mine shaft.", "I also rose, and both of us stood motionless for a time, straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take on a vital quality.", "Then without apparent volition we began to move toward the door, whose rattling in the gale held a comforting suggestion of earthly reality.", "The chanting in the depths\u2014for such the sound now seemed to be\u2014grew in volume and distinctness; and we felt irresistibly urged out into the storm and thence to the gaping blackness of the shaft.", "We encountered no living creature, for the men of the night shift had been released from duty, and were doubtless at the Dry Gulch settlement pouring sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender.", "From the watchman\u2019s cabin, however, gleamed a small square of yellow light like a guardian eye.", "I dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affected the watchman; but Romero was moving more swiftly now, and I followed without pausing.", "As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite.", "It struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices.", "I have, as you are aware, been much in India.", "Romero and I moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance.", "At one time I fancied I had gone mad\u2014this was when, on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle, I realized that the ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid lustre through the damp, heavy air around.", "It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many wide ladders, broke into a run and left me alone.", "Some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in a startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the cavern\u2019s gloom.", "I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders.", "And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of my perception to note that his speech, when articulate, was not of any sort known to me.", "Harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad Spanish and worse English, and of these, only the oft repeated cry \"Huitzilopotchli\" seemed in the least familiar.", "Later I definitely placed that word in the works of a great historianPrescott, Conquest of Mexico\u2014and shuddered when the association came to me.", "The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief, beginning just as I reached the final cavern of the journey.", "Out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive.", "In that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race.", "Simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me.", "I had arrived at the abyss, which was now redly aglow, and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero.", "Advancing, I peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could fathom, and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous uproar.", "At first I beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity; but then shapes, all infinitely distant, began to detach themselves from the confusion, and I saw\u2014was it Juan Romero?\u2014but God!", "I dare not tell you what I saw!\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.", "Some power from heaven, coming to my aid, obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when two universes collide in space.", "Chaos supervened, and I knew the peace of oblivion.", "I hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved; but I will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent.", "When I awakened, I was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window.", "Some distance away the lifeless body of Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, including the camp doctor.", "The men were discussing the strange death of the Mexican as he lay asleep; a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had struck and shaken the mountain.", "No direct cause was evident, and an autopsy failed to show any reason why Romero should not be living.", "Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither Romero nor I had left the bunk-house during the night; that neither of us had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the Cactus range.", "That storm, said men who had ventured down the mine shaft, had caused extensive caving-in, and had completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before.", "When I asked the watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunder-bolt; he mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the snarling mountain wind\u2014nothing more.", "Nor do I doubt his word.", "Upon the resumption of work, Superintendent Arthur called upon some especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot where the gulf had appeared.", "Though hardly eager, they obeyed, and a deep boring was made.", "Results were very curious.", "The roof of the void, as seen when it was open, was not by any means thick; yet now the drills of the investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock.", "Finding nothing else, not even gold, the Superintendent abandoned his attempts; but a perplexed look occasionally steals over his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk.", "One other thing is curious.", "Shortly after waking on that morning after the storm, I noticed the unaccountable absence of my Hindoo ring from my finger.", "I had prized it greatly, yet nevertheless felt a sensation of relief at its disappearance.", "If one of my fellow-miners appropriated it, he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty, for despite advertisements and a police search, the ring was never seen again.", "Somehow I doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands, for many strange things were taught me in India.", "My opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time.", "In broad daylight, and at most seasons I am apt to think the greater part of it a mere dream; but sometimes in the autumn, about two in the morning when the winds and animals howl dismally, there comes from inconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.", "and I feel that the transition of Juan Romero was a terrible one indeed"], "bn_00955099n": ["When I drew nigh the nameless city I knew it was accursed.", "I was

age-worn stones of this hoary survivor of the deluge, this great-grandfather of the eldest pyramid; and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should see, and no man else had dared to see..", "Remote in the desert of Araby lies the nameless city, crumbling and inarticulate, its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages.", "It must have been thus before the first stones of Memphis were laid, and while the bricks of Babylon were yet unbaked.", "There is no legend so old as to give it a name, or to recall that it was ever alive; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks so that all the tribes shun it without wholly knowing why.", "It was of this place that Abdul Alhazred the mad poet dreamed of the night before he sang his unexplained couplet:", "That is not dead which can eternal lie,", "And with strange aeons even death may die.", "I should have known that the Arabs had good reason for shunning the nameless city, the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living man, yet I defied them and went into the untrodden waste with my camel.", "I alone have seen it, and that is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as mine; why no other man shivers so horribly when the night wind rattles the windows.", "When I came upon it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep it looked at me, chilly from the rays of a cold moon amidst the desert's heat.", "And as I returned its look I forgot my triumph at finding it, and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawn.", "For hours I waited, till the east grew grey and the stars faded, and the grey turned to roseate light edged with gold.", "I heard a moaning and saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones though the sky was clear and the vast reaches of desert still.", "Then suddenly above the desert's far rim came the blazing edge of the sun, seen through the tiny sandstorm which was passing away, and in my fevered state I fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical metal to hail the fiery disc as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.", "My ears rang and my imagination seethed as I led my camel slowly across the sand to that unvocal place; that place which I alone of living men had seen.", "In and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and places I wandered, finding never a carving or inscription to tell of these men, if men they were, who built this city and dwelt therein so long ago.", "The antiquity of the spot was unwholesome, and I longed to encounter some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by mankind.", "There were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins which I did not like.", "I had with me many tools, and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices; but progress was slow, and nothing significant was revealed.", "When night and the moon returned I felt a chill wind which brought new fear, so that I did not dare to remain in the city.", "And as I went outside the antique walls to sleep, a small sighing sandstorm gathered behind me, blowing over the grey stones though the moon was bright and most of the desert still.", "I awakened just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams, my ears ringing as from some metallic peal.", "I saw the sun peering redly through the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless city, and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape.", "Once more I ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under a coverlet, and again dug vainly for relics of the forgotten race.", "At noon I rested, and in the afternoon I spent much time tracing the walls and bygone streets, and the outlines of the nearly vanished buildings.", "I saw that the city had been mighty indeed, and wondered at the sources of its greatness.", "To myself I pictured all the splendours of an age so distant that Chaldaea could not recall it, and thought of Sarnath the Doomed, that stood in the land of Mnar when mankind was young, and of Ib, that was carven of grey stone before mankind existed.", "All at once I came upon a place where the bed rock rose stark through the sand and formed a low cliff; and here I saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antediluvian people.", "Hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small, squat rock houses or temples; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation, though sandstorms had long effaced any carvings which may have been outside.", "Very low and sand-choked were all the dark apertures near me, but I cleared on with my spade and crawled through it, carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold.", "When I was inside I saw that the cavern was indeed a temple, and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshiped before the desert was a desert.", "Primitive altars, pillars, and niches, all curiously low, were not absent; and though I saw no sculptures or frescoes, there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means.", "The lowness of the chiseled chamber was very strange, for I could hardly kneel upright; but the area was so great that my torch showed only part of it at a time.", "I shuddered oddly in some of the far corners; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible, revolting and inexplicable nature and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple.", "When I had seen all that the place contained, I crawled out again, avid to find what the temples might yield.", "Night had now approached, yet the tangible things I had seen made curiosity stronger than fear, so that I did not flee from the long mooncast shadows that had daunted me when first I saw the nameless city.", "In the twilight I cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it, finding more vague stones and symbols, though nothing more definite than the other temple had contained.", "The room was just as low, but much less broad, ending in a very narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines.", "About these shrines I was prying when the noise of a wind and my camel outside broke through the stillness and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beast.", "The moon was gleaming vividly over the primitive ruins, lighting a dense cloud of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead of me.", "I knew it was this chilly, sandy wind which had disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a place of better shelter when I chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop the cliff.", "This astonished me and made me fearful again, but I immediately recalled the sudden local winds that I had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset, and judged it was a normal thing.", "I decided it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave, and watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source; soon perceiving that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south of me, almost out of sight.", "Against the choking sand-cloud I plodded toward this temple, which as I neared it loomed larger than the rest, and shewed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand.", "I would have entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind almost quenched my torch.", "It poured madly out of the dark door, sighing uncannily as it ruffled the sand and spread among the weird ruins.", "Soon it grew fainter and the sand grew more and more still, till finally all was at rest again; but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the city, and when I glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though mirrored in unquiet waters.", "I was more afraid than I could explain, but not enough to dull my thirst for wonder; so as soon as the wind was quite gone I crossed into the dark chamber from which it had come.", "This temple, as I had fancied from the outside, was larger than either of those I had visited before; and was presumably a natural cavern since it bore winds from some region beyond.", "Here I could stand quite upright, but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in the other temples.", "On the walls and roof I beheld for the first time some traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race, curious curling streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away; and on two of the altars I saw with rising excitement a maze of well-fashioned curvilinear carvings.", "As I held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the shape of the roof was too regular to be natural, and I wondered what the prehistoric cutters of stone had first worked upon.", "Their engineering skill must have been vast.", "Then a brighter flare of the fantastic flame showed that form which I had been seeking, the opening to those remoter abysses whence the sudden wind had blown; and I grew faint when I saw that it was a small and plainly artificial door chiseled in the solid rock.", "I thrust my torch within, beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small, numerous and steeply descending steps.", "I shall always see those steps in my dreams, for I came to learn what they meant.", "At the time I hardly knew whether to call them steps or mere footholds in a precipitous descent.", "My mind was whirling with mad thoughts, and the words and warning of Arab prophets seemed to float across the desert from the land that men know to the nameless city that men dare not know.", "Yet I hesitated only for a moment before advancing through the portal and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep passage, feet first, as though on a ladder.", "It is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any other man can have such a descent as mine.", "The narrow passage led infinitely down like some hideous haunted well, and the torch I held above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which I was crawling.", "I lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch, though I was frightened when I thought of the distance I must have been traversing.", "There were changes of direction and of steepness; and once I came to a long, low, level passage where I had to wriggle my feet first along the rocky floor, holding torch at arm's length beyond my head.", "The place was not high enough for kneeling.", "After that were more of the steep steps, and I was still scrambling down interminably when my failing torch died out.", "I do not think I noticed it at the time, for when I did notice it I was still holding it above me as if it were ablaze.", "I was quite unbalanced with that instinct for the strange and the unknown which had made me a wanderer upon earth and a haunter of far, ancient, and forbidden places.", "In the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished treasury of daemonic lore; sentences from Alhazred the mad Arab, paragraphs from the apocryphal nightmares of Damascius, and infamous lines from the delirious Image du Monde of Gauthier de Metz.", "I repeated queer extracts, and muttered of Afrasiab and the daemons that floated with him down the Oxus; later chanting over and over again a phrase from one of Lord Dunsany's tales\u2014\"The unreverberate blackness of the abyss.\"", "Once when the descent grew amazingly steep I recited something in sing-song from Thomas Moore until I feared to recite more:", "A reservoir of darkness, black", "As witches' cauldrons are, when fill'd", "With moon-drugs in th' eclipse distill'd", "Leaning to look if foot might pass", "Down thro' that chasm, I saw, beneath,", "As far as vision could explore,", "The jetty sides as smooth as glass,", "Looking as if just varnish'd o'er", "With that dark pitch the Seat of Death", "Throws out upon its slimy shore.", "Time had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor, and I found myself in a place slightly higher than the rooms in the two smaller temples now so incalculably far above my head.", "I could not quite stand, but could kneel upright, and in the dark I shuffled and crept hither and thither at random.", "I soon knew that I was in a narrow passage whose walls were lined with cases of wood having glass fronts.", "As in that Palaeozoic and abysmal place I felt of such things as polished wood and glass I shuddered at the possible implications.", "The cases were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular intervals, and were oblong and horizontal, hideously like coffins in shape and size.", "When I tried to move two or three for further examination, I found that they were firmly fastened.", "I saw that the passage was a long one, so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping run that would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in the blackness; crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure the walls and rows of cases still stretched on.", "Man is so used to thinking visually that I almost forgot the darkness and pictured the endless corridor of wood and glass in its low-studded monotony as though I saw it.", "And then in a moment of indescribable emotion I did see it.", "Just when my fancy merged into real sight I cannot tell; but there came a gradual glow ahead, and all at once I knew that I saw the dim outlines of a corridor and the cases, revealed by some unknown subterranean phosphorescence.", "For a little while all was exactly as I had imagined it, since the glow was very faint; but as I mechanically kept stumbling ahead into the stronger light I realized that my fancy had been but feeble.", "This hall was no relic of crudity like the temples in the city above, but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art.", "Rich, vivid, and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of mural paintings whose lines and colours were beyond description.", "The cases were of a strange golden wood, with fronts of exquisite glass, and containing the mummified forms of creatures outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic dreams of man.", "To convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible.", "They were of the reptile kind, with body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile, sometimes the seal, but more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the palaeontologist ever heard.", "In size they approximated a small man, and their fore-legs bore delicate and evident feet curiously like human hands and fingers.", "But strangest of all were their heads, which presented a contour violating all known biological principles.", "To nothing can such things be well compared\u2014in one flash I thought of comparisons as varied as the cat, the bullfrog, the mythic Satyr, and the human being.", "Not Jove himself had had so colossal and protuberant a forehead, yet the horns and the noselessness and the alligator-like jaw placed things outside all established categories.", "I debated for a time on the reality of the mummies, half suspecting they were artificial idols; but soon decided they were indeed some palaeogean species which had lived when the nameless city was alive.", "To crown their grotesqueness, most of them were gorgeously enrobed in the costliest of fabrics, and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold, jewels, and unknown shining metals.", "The importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast, for they held first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and ceiling.", "With matchless skill had the artist drawn them in a world of their own, wherein they had cities and gardens fashioned to suit their dimensions; and I could not help but think that their pictured history was allegorical, perhaps shewing the progress of the race that worshiped them.", "These creatures, I said to myself, were to men of the nameless city what the she-wolf was to Rome, or some totem-beast is to a tribe of Indians.", "Holding this view, I could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the nameless city; the tale of a mighty seacoast metropolis that ruled the world before Africa rose out of the waves, and of its struggles as the sea shrank away, and the desert crept into the fertile valley that held it.", "I saw its wars and triumphs, its troubles and defeats, and afterwards its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its people\u2014here represented in allegory by the grotesque reptiles\u2014were driven to chisel their way down though the rocks in some marvelous manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them.", "It was all vividly weird and realistic, and its connection with the awesome descent I had made was unmistakable.", "I even recognized the passages.", "As I crept along the corridor toward the brighter light I saw later stages of the painted epic\u2014the leave-taking of the race that had dwelt in the nameless city and the valley around for ten million years; the race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so long where they had settled as nomads in the earth's youth, hewing in the virgin rock those primal shrines at which they had never ceased to worship.", "Now that the light was better I studied the pictures more closely and, remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the unknown men, pondered upon the customs of the nameless city.", "Many things were peculiar and inexplicable.", "The civilization, which included a written alphabet, had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably later civilizations of Egypt and Chaldaea, yet there were curious omissions.", "I could, for example, find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral customs, save such as were related to wars, violence, and plagues; and I wondered at the reticence shown concerning natural death.", "It was as though an ideal of immortality had been fostered as a cheering illusion.", "Still nearer the end of the passage was painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness and extravagance: contrasted views of the nameless city in its desertion and growing ruin, and of the strange new realm of paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone.", "In these views the city and the desert valley were shewn always by moonlight, golden nimbus hovering over the fallen walls, and half-revealing the splendid perfection of former times, shown spectrally and elusively by the artist.", "The paradisal scenes were almost too extravagant to be believed, portraying a hidden world of eternal day filled with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys.", "At the very last I thought I saw signs of an artistic anticlimax.", "The paintings were less skillful, and much more bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier scenes.", "They seemed to record a slow decadence of the ancient stock, coupled with a growing ferocity toward the outside world from which it was driven by the desert.", "The forms of the people\u2014always represented by the sacred reptiles\u2014appeared to be gradually wasting away, though their spirit as shewn hovering above the ruins by moonlight gained in proportion.", "Emaciated priests, displayed as reptiles in ornate robes, cursed the upper air and all who breathed it; and one terrible final scene shewed a primitive-looking man, perhaps a pioneer of ancient Irem, the City of Pillars, torn to pieces by members of the elder race.", "I remember how the Arabs fear the nameless city, and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and ceiling were bare.", "As I viewed the pageant of mural history I had approached very closely to the end of the low-ceiled hall, and was aware of a gate through which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence.", "Creeping up to it, I cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond; for instead of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of uniform radiance, such one might fancy when gazing down from the peak of Mount Everest upon a sea of sunlit mist.", "Behind me was a passage so cramped that I could not stand upright in it; before me was an infinity of subterranean effulgence.", "Reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of steps\u2014small numerous steps like those of black passages I had traversed\u2014but after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed everything.", "Swung back open against the left-hand wall of the passage was a massive door of brass, incredibly thick and decorated with fantastic bas-reliefs, which could if closed shut the whole inner world of light away from the vaults and passages of rock.", "I looked at the step, and for the nonce dared not try them.", "I touched the open brass door, and could not move it.", "Then I sank prone to the stone floor, my mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a death-like exhaustion could banish.", "As I lay still with closed eyes, free to ponder, many things I had lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible significance\u2014scenes representing the nameless city in its heyday\u2014the vegetations of the valley around it, and the distant lands with which its merchants traded.", "The allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me by its universal prominence, and I wondered that it would be so closely followed in a pictured history of such importance.", "In the frescoes the nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the reptiles.", "I wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been, and reflected a moment on certain oddities I had noticed in the ruins.", "I thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the underground corridor, which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference to the reptile deities there honoured; though it perforce reduced the worshipers to crawling.", "Perhaps the very rites here involved crawling in imitation of the creatures.", "No religious theory, however, could easily explain why the level passages in that awesome descent should be as low as the temples\u2014or lower, since one could not even kneel in it.", "As I thought of the crawling creatures, whose hideous mummified forms were so close to me, I felt a new throb of fear.", "Mental associations are curious, and I shrank from the idea that except for the poor primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting, mine was the only human form amidst the many relics and symbols of the primordial life.", "But as always in my strange and roving existence, wonder soon drove out fear; for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a problem worthy of the greatest explorer.", "That a weird world of mystery lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps I could not doubt, and I hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted corridor had failed to give.", "The frescoes had pictured unbelievable cities, and valleys in this lower realm, and my fancy dwelt on the rich and colossal ruins that awaited me.", "My fears, indeed, concerned the past rather than the future.", "Not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes, miles below the world I knew and faced by another world of eerie light and mist, could match the lethal dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul.", "An ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and rock-hewn temples of the nameless city, while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten, with only here and there some vaguely familiar outlines.", "Of what could have happened in the geological ages since the paintings ceased and the death-hating race resentfully succumbed to decay, no man might say.", "Life had once teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond; now I was alone with vivid relics, and I trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent deserted vigil.", "Suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since I first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon, and despite my exhaustion I found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world.", "My sensations were like those which had made me shun the nameless city at night, and were as inexplicable as they were poignant.", "In another moment, however, I received a still greater shock in the form of a definite sound\u2014the first which had broken the utter silence of these tomb-like depths.", "It was a deep, low moaning, as of a distant throng of condemned spirits, and came from the direction in which I was staring.", "Its volume rapidly grew, till it soon reverberated  rightfully through the low passage, and at the same time I became conscious of an increasing draught of old air, likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above.", "The touch of this air seemed to restore my balance, for I instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the abyss each sunset and sunrise, one of which had indeed revealed the hidden tunnels to me.", "I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near, so bracing myself to resist the gale that was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening.", "My fear again waned low, since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the unknown.", "More and more madly poured the shrieking, moaning night wind into the gulf of the inner earth.", "I dropped prone again and clutched vainly at the floor for fear of being swept bodily through the open gate into the phosphorescent abyss.", "Such fury I had not expected, and as I grew aware of an actual slipping of my form toward the abyss I was beset by a thousand new terrors of apprehension and imagination.", "The malignancy of the blast awakened incredible fancies; once more I compared myself shudderingly to the only human image in that frightful corridor, the man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race, for in the fiendish clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive rage all the stronger because it was largely impotent.", "I think I screamed frantically near the last\u2014I was almost mad\u2014of the howling wind-wraiths.", "I tried to crawl against the murderous invisible torrent, but I could not even hold my own as I was pushed slowly and inexorably toward the unknown world.", "Finally reason must have wholly snapped; for I fell babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the mad Arab Alhazred, who dreamed of the nameless city:", "That is not dead which can eternal lie,", "And with strange aeons even death may die.", "Only the grim brooding desert gods know what really took place\u2014what indescribable struggles and scrambles in the dark I endured or what Abaddon guided me back to life, where I must always remember and shiver in the night wind till oblivion\u2014or worse\u2014claims me.", "Monstrous, unnatural, colossal, was the thing\u2014too far beyond all the ideas of man to be believed except in the silent damnable small hours of the morning when one cannot sleep.", "I have said that the fury of the rushing blast was infernal\u2014cacodaemoniacal\u2014and that its voices were hideous with the pent-up viciousness of desolate eternities.", "Presently these voices, while still chaotic before me, seemed to my beating brain to take articulate form behind me; and down there in the grave of unnumbered aeon-dead antiquities, leagues below the dawn-lit world of men, I heard the ghastly cursing and snarling of strange-tongued fiends.", "Turning, I saw outlined against the luminous aether of the abyss what could not be seen against the dusk of the corridor\u2014a nightmare horde of rushing devils; hate distorted, grotesquely panoplied, half transparent devils of a race no man might mistake\u2014the crawling reptiles of the nameless city.", "And as the wind died away I was plunged into the ghoul-pooled darkness of earth's bowels; for behind the last of the creatures the great brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.", "Category:Cthulhu Mythos Category:Horror short stories Category:Modern work"], "bn_03396420n": ["It was a dark autumn night.", "The old banker was pacing from corner to corner of his study, recalling to his mind the party he gave in the autumn fifteen years ago.", "There were many clever people at the party and much interesting conversation.", "They talked among other things of capital punishment.", "The guests, among them not a few scholars and journalists, for the most part disapproved of capital punishment.", "They found it obsolete as a means of punishment, unfitted to a Christian State and immoral.", "Some of them thought that capital punishment should be replaced universally by life-imprisonment.", "\"I don't agree with you,\" said the host.", "\"I myself have experienced neither capital punishment nor life-imprisonment, but if one may judge a priori, then in my opinion capital punishment is more moral and more humane than imprisonment.", "Execution kills instantly, life-imprisonment kills by degrees.", "Who is the more humane executioner, one who kills you in a few seconds or one who draws

the chief foes of a prisoner; besides, nothing is more boring than to drink good wine alone,\" and tobacco spoils the air in his room.", "During the first year the lawyer was sent books of a light

myrrh in his hair, nor his chaplet of vine-leaves, nor the youth in his golden voice.", "At evening Iranon sang, and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw a nimbus over the singer's head.", "But most of the men of Teloth yawned, and some laughed and some went to sleep; for Iranon told nothing useful, singing only his memories, his dreams, and his hopes.", "\"I remember the twilight, the moon, and soft songs, and the window where I was rocked to sleep.", "And through the window was the street where the golden lights came, and where the shadows danced on houses of marble.", "I remember the square of moonlight on the floor, that was not like any other light, and the visions that danced on the moonbeams when my mother sang to me.", "And too, I remember the sun of morning bright above the many-coloured hills in summer, and the sweetness of flowers borne on the south wind that made the trees sing.", "\"Oh Aira, city of marble and beryl, how many are thy beauties!", "How I loved the warm and fragrant groves across the hyaline Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra that flowed though the verdant valley!", "In those groves and in the vale the children

stars.", "\"And in the city were the palaces of veined and tinted marble, with golden domes and painted walls, and green gardens with cerulean pools and crystal fountains.", "Often I played in the gardens and waded in the pools, and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees.", "And sometimes at sunset I would climb the long hilly street to the citadel and the open place, and look down upon Aira, the magic city of marble and beryl, splendid in a robe of golden flame.", "\"Long have I missed thee, Aira, for I was but young when we went into exile; but my father was thy King and

more, when shall happiness find you?", "Ye toil to live, but is not life made of beauty and song?", "And if ye suffer no singers among you, where shall be the fruits of your toil?", "Toil without song is like a weary journey without an end.", "Were not death more pleasing?\"", "But the archon was sullen and did not understand, and rebuked the stranger.", "\"Thou art a strange youth, and I like not

name often changeth.", "Let us go to Oonai, O Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers, nor even laugh or frown at what we say.\"", "And Iranon answered: \"Be it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he must seek the mountains and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine by the sluggish Zuro.", "But think not that delight and understanding dwell just across the Karthian hills, or in any spot thou canst find in a day's, or a year's, or a lustrum's journey.", "Behold, when I was small like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari, where none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when older I would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling dromedary-men in the marketplace.", "But when I went to Sinara I found the dromedary-men all drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not as mine, so I travelled in a barge down the Xari to onyx-walled Jaren.", "And the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I wandered to many cities.", "I have seen Stethelos that is below the great cataract, and have gazed on the marsh where Sarnath once stood.",

Oonai across the Karthianhills, which may indeed be Aira, though I think not.", "Aira's beauty is past imagining, and none can tell of it without rapture, whilist of Oonai the camel-drivers whisper leeringly.\"", "At the sunset Iranon and small Romnod went forth from Teloth, and for long wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests.", "The way was rough and obscure, and never did they seem nearer to Oonai the city of lutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon would sing of Aira and its beauties and Romnod would listen, so that they were both happy after a fashion.", "They ate plentifully of fruit and red berries, and marked not the passing of time, but many years must have slipped away.", "Small Romnod was now not so small, and spoke deeply instead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods.", "So it came to pass that Romnod seemed older than Iranon, though he had been very small when Iranon had found him watching for green budding branches in Teloth beside the sluggish stone-banked Zuro.", "Then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad light of Oonai.", "Peasants had told them they were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his native city of Aira.", "The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira; for they were harsh and glaring, while the lights of Aira shine as softly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window where Iranon's mother once rocked him to sleep with song.", "But Oonai was a city of lutes and dancing, so Iranon and Romnod went down the steep slope that they might find men to whom sings and dreams would bring pleasure.", "And when they were come into the town they found rose-wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies, who listened to the songs of Iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done.", "Then for a moment did Iranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he, though the town was not a hundredth as fair as Aira.", "When dawn came Iranon looked about with dismay, for the domes of Oonai were not golden in the sun, but grey and dismal.", "And the men of Oonai were pale with revelling, and dull with wine, and unlike the radiant men of Aira.", "But because the people had thrown him blossoms and acclaimed his sings Iranon stayed on, and with him Romnod, who liked the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and myrtle.", "Often at night Iranon sang to the revellers, but he was always as before, crowned only in the vine of the mountains and remembering the marble streets of Aira and the hyaline Nithra.", "In the frescoed halls of the Monarch did he sing, upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that was a mirror, and as he sang, he brought pictures to his hearers till the floor seemed to reflect old, beautiful, and half-remembered things instead of the wine-reddened feasters who pelted him with roses.", "And the King bade him put away his tattered purple, and clothed him in satin and cloth-of-gold, with rings of green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flower-embroidered silk.", "Thus dwelt Iranon in Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing.", "It is not known how long Iranon tarried in Oonai, but one day the King brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the Liranian desert, and dusky flute-players from Drinen in the East, and after that the revellers threw their roses not so much at Iranon as at the dancers and flute-players.", "And day by day that Romnod who had been a small boy in granite Teloth grew coarser and redder with wine, till he dreamed less and less, and listened with less delight to the songs of Iranon.", "But though Iranon was sad, he ceased not to sing, and at evening told again of his dreams of Aira, the city of marble and beryl.", "Then one night the reddened and fattened Romnod snorted heavily amidst the poppied silks of his banquet-couch and died writhing, whilst Iranon, pale and slender, sang to himself in a far corner.", "And when Iranon had wept over the grave of Romnod and strewn it with green branches, such as Romnod used to love, he put aside his silks and gauds and went forgotten out of Oonai the city of lutes and dancing clad only in the ragged purple in which he had come, and garlanded with fresh vines from the mountains.", "Into the sunset wandered Iranon, seeking still for his native land and for men who would understand his songs and dreams.", "In all the cities of Cydathria and in the lands beyond the Bnazie desert gay-faced children laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of purple; but Iranon stayed ever young, and wore wreathes upon his golden head whilst he sang of Aira, delight of the past and hope of the future.", "So came he one night to the squallid cot of an antique shepherd, bent and dirty, who kept flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh.", "To this man Iranon spoke, as to so many others: \"Canst thou tell me where I may find Aira, the city of marble and beryl, where flows the hyaline Nithra and where the falls of the tiny Kra sing to the verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees?\" and the shepherd, hearing, looked long and strangely at Iranon, as if recalling something very far away in time, and noted each line of the stranger's face, and his golden hair, and his crown of vine-leaves.", "But he was old, and shook his head as he replied: \"O stranger, I have indeed heard the name of Aira, and the other names thou hast spoken, but they come to me from afar down the waste of long years.", "I heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate, a beggar's boy given to strange dreams, who would weave long tales about the moon and the flowers and the west wind.", "We used to laugh at him, for we knew him from his birth though he thought himself a King's son.", "He was comely, even as thou, but full of folly and strangeness; and he ran away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs and dreams.", "How often hath he sung to me of lands that never were, and things that never can be!", "Of Aira did he speak much; of Aira and the river Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra.", "There would he ever say he once dwelt as a Prince, though here we knew him from his birth.", "Nor was there ever a marble city of Aira, or those who could delight in strange songs, save in the dreams of mine old playmate Iranon who is gone.\"", "And in the twilight, as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast on the marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the floor as he is rocked to sleep at evening, there walked into the lethal quicksands a very old man in tattered purple, crowned with whithered vine-leaves and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city where dreams are understood.", "That night something of youth and beauty died in the elder world"], "bn_01304399n": ["I have examined maps of the city with the greatest care, yet have never again found the Rue d'Auseil.", "These maps have not been modern maps alone, for I know that names change.", "I have, on the contrary, delved deeply into all the antiquities of the place, and have personally explored every region, of whatever name, which could possibly answer to the street I knew as the Rue d'Auseil.", "But despite all I have done, it remains an humiliating fact that I cannot find the house, the street, or even the locality, where, during the last months of my impoverished life as a student of metaphysics at the university, I heard the music of Erich Zann.", "That my memory is broken, I do not wonder; for my health, physical and mental, was gravely disturbed throughout the period of my residence in the Rue d'Auseil, and I recall that I took none of my few acquaintances there.", "But that I cannot find the place again is both singular and perplexing; for it was within a half-hour's walk of the university and was distinguished by peculiarities which could hardly be forgotten by any one who had been there.", "I have never met a person who has seen the Rue d'Auseil.", "The Rue d'Auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blear-windowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone.", "It was always shadowy along that river, as if the smoke of neighboring factories shut out the sun perpetually.", "The river was also odorous with evil stenches which I have never smelled elsewhere, and which may some day help me to find it, since I should recognize them at once.", "Beyond the bridge were narrow cobbled streets with rails; and then came the ascent, at first gradual, but incredibly steep as the Rue d'Auseil was reached.", "I have never seen another street as narrow and steep as the Rue d'Auseil.", "It was almost a cliff, closed to all vehicles, consisting in several places of flights of steps, and ending at the top in a lofty ivied wall.", "Its paving was irregular, sometimes stone slabs, sometimes cobblestones, and sometimes bare earth with struggling greenish-grey vegetation.", "The houses were tall, peaked-roofed, incredibly old, and crazily leaning backward, forward, and sidewise.", "Occasionally an opposite pair, both leaning forward, almost met across the street like an arch; and certainly they kept most of the light from the ground below.", "There were a few overhead bridges from house to house across the street.", "The inhabitants of that street impressed me peculiarly; At first I thought it was because they were all silent and reticent; but later decided it was because they were all very old.", "I do not know how I came to live on such a street, but I was not myself when I moved there.", "I had been living in many poor places, always evicted for want of money; until at last I came upon that tottering house in the Rue d'Auseil kept by the paralytic Blandot.", "It was the third house from the top of the street, and by far the tallest of them all.", "My room was on the fifth story; the only inhabited room there, since the house was almost empty.", "On the night I arrived I heard strange music from the peaked garret overhead, and the next day asked old Blandot about it.", "He told me it was an old German viol-player, a strange dumb man who signed his name as Erich Zann, and who played evenings in a cheap theater orchestra; adding that Zann's desire to play in the night after his return from the theater was the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable window was the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond.", "Thereafter I heard Zann every night, and although he kept me awake, I was haunted by the weirdness of his music.", "Knowing little of the art myself, I was yet certain that none of his harmonies had any relation to music I had heard before; and concluded that he was a composer of highly original genius.", "The longer I listened, the more I was fascinated, until after a week I resolved to make the old man's acquaintance.", "One night as he was returning from his work, I intercepted Zann in the hallway and told him that I would like to know him and be with him when he played.", "He was a small, lean, bent person, with shabby clothes, blue eyes, grotesque, satyrlike face, and nearly bald head; and at my first words seemed both angered and frightened.", "My obvious friendliness, however, finally melted him; and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow him up the dark, creaking and rickety attic stairs.", "His room, one of only two in the steeply pitched garret, was on the west side, toward the high wall that formed the upper end of the street.", "Its size was very great, and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary barrenness and neglect.", "Of furniture there was only a narrow iron bedstead, a dingy wash-stand, a small table, a large bookcase, an iron music-rack, and three old-fashioned chairs.", "Sheets of music were piled in disorder about the floor.", "The walls were of bare boards, and had probably never known plaster; whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited.", "Evidently Erich Zann's world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imagination.", "Motioning me to sit down, the dumb man closed the door, turned the large wooden bolt, and lighted a candle to augment the one he had brought with him.", "He now removed his viol from its motheaten covering, and taking it, seated himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs.", "He did not employ the music-rack, but, offering no choice and playing from memory, enchanted me for over an hour with strains I had never heard before; strains which must have been of his own devising.", "To describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in music.", "They were a kind of fugue, with recurrent passages of the most captivating quality, but to me were notable for the absence of any of the weird notes I had overheard from my room below on other occasions.", "Those haunting notes I had remembered, and had often hummed and whistled inaccurately to myself, so when the player at length laid down his bow I asked him if he would render some of them.", "As I began my request the wrinkled satyrlike face lost the bored placidity it had possessed during the playing, and seemed to show the same curious mixture of anger and fright which I had noticed when first I accosted the old man.", "For a moment I was inclined to use persuasion, regarding rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to awaken my host's weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which I had listened the night before.", "But I did not pursue this course for more than a moment; for when the dumb musician recognized the whistled air his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis, and his long, cold, bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and silence the crude imitation.", "As he did this he further demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a startled glance toward the lone curtained window, as if fearful of some intruder\u2014a glance doubly absurd, since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the adjacent roofs, this window being the only point on the steep street, as the concierge had told me, from which one could see over the wall at the summit.", "The old man's glance brought Blandot's remark to my mind, and with a certain capriciousness I felt a wish to look out over the wide and dizzying panorama of moonlit roofs and city lights beyond the hilltop, which of all the dwellers in the Rue d'Auseil only this crabbed musician could see.", "I moved toward the window and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains, when with a frightened rage even greater than before, the dumb lodger was upon me again; this time motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me thither with both hands.", "Now thoroughly disgusted with my host, I ordered him to release me, and told him I would go at once.", "His clutch relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offense, his own anger seemed to subside.", "He tightened his relaxing grip, but this time in a friendly manner, forcing me into a chair; then with an appearance of wistfulness crossing to the littered table, where he wrote many words with a pencil, in the labored French of a foreigner.", "The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness.", "Zann said that he was old, lonely, and afflicted with strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music and with other things.", "He had enjoyed my listening to his music, and wished I would come again and not mind his eccentricities.", "But he could not play to another his weird harmonies, and could not bear hearing them from another; nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by another.", "He had not known until our hallway conversation that I could overhear his playing in my room, and now asked me if I would arrange with Blandot to take a lower room where I could not hear him in the night.", "He would, he wrote, defray the difference in rent.", "As I sat deciphering the execrable French, I felt more lenient toward the old man.", "He was a victim of physical and nervous suffering, as was I; and my metaphysical studies had taught me kindness.", "In the silence there came a slight sound from the window\u2014the shutter must have rattled in the night wind, and for some reason I started almost as violently as did Erich Zann.", "So when I had finished reading, I shook my host by the hand, and departed as a friend.", "The next day Blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor, between the apartments of an aged money-lender and the room of a respectable upholsterer.", "There was no one on the fourth floor.", "It was not long before I found that Zann's eagerness for my company was not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story.", "He did not ask me to call on him, and when I did call he appeared uneasy and played listlessly.", "This was always at night\u2014in the day he slept and would admit no one.", "My liking for him did not grow, though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me.", "I had a curious desire to look out of that window, over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there.", "Once I went up to the garret during theater hours, when Zann was away, but the door was locked.", "What I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man.", "At first I would tip-toe up to my old fifth floor, then I grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret.", "There in the narrow hall, outside the bolted door with the covered keyhole, I often heard sounds which filled me with an indefinable dread\u2014the dread of vague wonder and brooding mystery.", "It was not that the sounds were hideous, for they were not; but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth, and that at certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which I could hardly conceive as produced by one player.", "Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild power.", "As the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold.", "He now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs.", "Then one night as I listened at the door, I heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real\u2014the awful, inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter, and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish.", "I knocked repeatedly at the door, but received no response.", "Afterward I waited in the black hallway, shivering with cold and fear, till I heard the poor musician's feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair.", "Believing him just conscious after a fainting fit, I renewed my rapping, at the same time calling out my name reassuringly.", "I heard Zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which he falteringly unfastened to admit me.", "This time his delight at having me present was real; for his distorted face gleamed with relief while he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its mother's skirts.", "Shaking pathetically, the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank into another, beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the floor.", "He sat for some time inactive, nodding oddly, but having a paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening.", "Subsequently he seemed to be satisfied, and crossing to a chair by the table wrote a brief note, handed it to me, and returned to the table, where he began to write rapidly and incessantly.", "The note implored me in the name of mercy, and for the sake of my own curiosity, to wait where I was while he prepared a full account in German of all the marvels and terrors which beset him.", "I waited, and the dumb man's pencil flew.", "It was perhaps an hour later, while I still waited and while the old musician's feverishly written sheets still continued to pile up, that I saw Zann start as from the hint of a horrible shock.", "Unmistakably he was looking at the curtained window and listening shudderingly.", "Then I half fancied I heard a sound myself; though it was not a horrible sound, but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical note, suggesting a player in one of the neighboring houses, or in some abode beyond the lofty wall over which I had never been able to look.", "Upon Zann the effect was terrible, for, dropping his pencil, suddenly he rose, seized his viol, and commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing I had ever heard from his bow save when listening at the barred door.", "It would be useless to describe the playing of Erich Zann on that dreadful night.", "It was more horrible than anything I had ever overheard, because I could now see the expression of his face, and could realize that this time the motive was stark fear.", "He was trying to make a noise; to ward something off or drown something out\u2014what, I could not imagine, awesome though I felt it must be.", "The playing grew fantastic, delirious, and hysterical, yet kept to the last the qualities of supreme genius which I knew this strange old man possessed.", "I recognized the air\u2014it was a wild Hungarian dance popular in the theaters, and I reflected for a moment that this was the first time I had ever heard Zann play the work of another composer.", "Louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate viol.", "The player was dripping with an uncanny perspiration and twisted like a monkey, always looking frantically at the curtained window.", "In his frenzied strains I could almost see shadowy satyrs and bacchanals dancing and whirling insanely through seething abysses of clouds and smoke and lightning.", "And then I thought I heard a shriller, steadier note that was not from the viol; a calm, deliberate, purposeful, mocking note from far away in the West.", "At this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night wind which had sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within.", "Zann's screaming viol now outdid itself emitting sounds I had never thought a viol could emit.", "The shutter rattled more loudly, unfastened, and commenced slamming against the window.", "Then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts, and the chill wind rushed in, making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the table where Zann had begun to write out his horrible secret.", "I looked at Zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation.", "His blue eyes were bulging, glassy and sightless, and the frantic playing had become a blind, mechanical, unrecognizable orgy that no pen could even suggest.", "A sudden gust, stronger than the others, caught up the manuscript and bore it toward the window.", "I followed the flying sheets in desperation, but they were gone before I reached the demolished panes.", "Then I remembered my old wish to gaze from this window, the only window in the Rue d'Auseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall, and the city outspread beneath.", "It was very dark, but the city's lights always burned, and I expected to see them there amidst the rain and wind.", "Yet when I looked from that highest of all gable windows, looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the night-wind, I saw no city spread below, and no friendly lights gleamed from remembered streets, but only the blackness of space illimitable; unimagined space alive with motion and music, and having no semblance of anything on earth.", "And as I stood there looking in terror, the wind blew out both the candles in that ancient peaked garret, leaving me in savage and impenetrable darkness with chaos and pandemonium before me, and the demon madness of that night-baying viol behind me.", "I staggered back in the dark, without the means of striking a light, crashing against the table, overturning a chair, and finally groping my way to the place where the blackness screamed with shocking music.", "To save myself and Erich Zann", "I could at least try, whatever the powers opposed to me.", "Once I thought some chill thing brushed me, and I screamed, but my scream could not be heard above that hideous viol.", "Suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing bow struck me, and I knew I was close to the player.", "I felt ahead, touched the back of Zann's chair, and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to bring him to his senses.", "He did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening.", "I moved my hand to his head, whose mechanical nodding I was able to stop, and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown things of the night.", "But he neither answered me nor abated the frenzy of his unutterable music, while all through the garret strange currents of wind seemed to dance in the darkness and babel.", "When my hand touched his ear I shuddered, though I knew not why\u2014knew not why till I felt the still face; the ice-cold, stiffened, unbreathing face whose glassy eyes bulged uselessly into the void.", "And then, by some miracle, finding the door and the large wooden bolt, I plunged wildly away from that glassy-eyed thing in the dark, and from the ghoulish howling of that accursed viol whose fury increased even as I plunged.", "Leaping, floating, flying down those endless stairs through the dark house; racing mindlessly out into the narrow, steep, and ancient street of steps and tottering houses; clattering down steps and over cobbles to the lower streets and the putrid canyon-walled river; panting across the great dark bridge to the broader, healthier streets and boulevards we know; all these are terrible impressions that linger with me.", "And I recall that there was no wind, and that the moon was out, and that all the lights of the city twinkled.", "Despite my most careful searches and investigations, I have never since been able to find the Rue d'Auseil.", "But I am not wholly sorry; either for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses of the closely-written sheets which alone could have explained the

her what had frightened her.", "\"There is a nasty frog,\" said she, \"at the door, who lifted my ball out of the spring last evening: I promised him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door and wants to come in!\"", "While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said,", "\"Open the door, my princess dear,", "Open the door to thy true love here!", "And mind the words that thou and I said", "By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.\"", "The king said to the young princess, \"As you have made a promise, you must keep it, so go and let him in.\"", "She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and came up close to the table.", "\"Pray lift me upon a chair,\" said he to the princess, \"and let me sit next to you.\"", "As soon as she had done this, the frog said, \"Put your plate closer to me that I may eat out of it.\"", "This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said \" Now I am tired; carry me up stairs and put me into your little bed.\"", "And the princess took him up in her hand and put him upon the pillow of her own little bed, where he slept all night along.", "As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped down stairs and went out of the house.", "\"Now,\" thought the princess, \"he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.\"", "But she was mistaken; for when night came again, she heard the same tapping at the door, and when she opened it, the frog came in and slept upon her pillow as before till the morning broke: and the third night he did the same; but when the princess awoke on the following morning, she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes that ever were seen, and standing at the head of her bed.", "He told he that he had been enchanted by a malicious fairy, who had changed him into the form of a frog, in which he was fated to remain till some princess should take him out of the spring and let him sleep upon her bed for three nights.", "\"You,\" said the prince, \"have broken this cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father's kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.\"", "The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in giving her consent; and as they spoke a splendid carriage drove up with eight beautiful horses decked with plumes of feathers and golden harness, and behind rode the prince's servant, the faithful Henry, who had bewailed the misfortune of his dear master so long and bitterly that his heart had well-nigh burst.", "Then all set out full of joy for the prince's kingdom; where they arrived safely, and lived happily a great many years"], "bn_03729229n": ["Well was it

herself to the punishment she deserved.", "The king of Long-Tower had once a son, who was the apple of his eye, and on whom he had built all his hopes; and he longed impatiently for the time when he should \ufb01nd some good match for him, and hear himself called grandpapa.", "But the prince was so averse to marriage and so obstinate, that whenever a wife was talked of he shook his head and wished himself a hundred miles off, so that the poor king, finding his son stubborn and perverse, and foreseeing that his race would come to an end, was more vexed and melancholy, cast down and out of spirits, than a merchant whose correspondent has become bankrupt, or a peasant whose ass has died.", "Neither could the tears of his father move the prince, nor the entreaties of the courtiers soften him, nor the counsel of wise men make him change his mind; in vain they set before his eyes the wishes of his father, the wants of the people, and his own interest, representing to him that he was the full-stop in the line of the royal race; for with the obstinacy of CarellaA person who was proverbially obstinate.", "and the stubbornness of an old mule with a skin four fingers thick, he had planted

it happened that one day, when all were at table, and the prince was cutting a piece of new-made cheese, whilst listening to the chit-chat that was going on, he accidentally cut his finger; and two drops of blood, falling upon the cheese, made such a beautiful mixture of colours, that\u2014either it was a punishment inflicted by Love, or the will of Heaven to console the poor father,\u2014the whim seized the prince to find a woman exactly as white and red as that cheese tinged with his blood.", "Then he said to his father, \"Sir, unless I have a wife as white and red as this cheese, it is all over with me: so now resolve, if you wish to see me alive and well, to give me all I require to go through the world in search of a beauty exactly like this cheese, or else I shall end my life and die by inches.\"", "\"When the king heard this mad resolution, he thought the house was falling about his ears; his colour came and went, but as soon as he recovered himself and could speak, he said, \"My son, the life of my soul, the core of my heart, the prop of my old-age, what mad-brained fancy has made you take leave of your senses?", "Have you lost your wits?", "You want either all or nothing: first you wish not to marry, on purpose to deprive me of an heir, and now you are impatient to drive me out of the world.", "Whither, O whither would you go wandering about, wasting your life?", "and why leave your house, your hearth, your home?", "You know not what toils and perils he brings on himself who goes rambling and roving.", "Let this whim pass, my son; be sensible, and do not wish to see my life worn out, this house fall to the ground, my household go to ruin.\"", "But these and other words went in at one ear and out at the other, and were all cast upon the sea; and the poor king, seeing that his son was as immoveable as a rook upon a belfryNa ciaola de canpanaro., gave him a handful of dollars, and two or three servants; and bidding him farewell, he felt as if his soul was torn out of his body.", "Then weeping bitterly, he went to a balcony, and followed his son with his eyes until he was lost to sight.", "The prince departed, leaving his unhappy father to his grief, and hastened on his way through fields and woods, over mountain and valley, hill and plain, visiting various countries, and mixing with various peoples, and always with his eyes wide awake to see whether he could \ufb01nd the object of his desire.", "At the end of several months he arrived at the coast of France, where, leaving his servants at an hospital with sore feet, he embarked alone in a Genoese boat, and set out toward the Straits of Gibraltar.", "There he took a larger vessel and sailed for the Indies, seeking everywhere, from kingdom to kingdom, from province to province, from country to country, from street to street, from house to house, in every hole and corner, whether he could find the original likeness of that beautiful image which he had pictured to his heart.", "And he wandered about and about, until at length he came to the Island of the Ogresses, where be cast anchor and landed.", "There he found an old old woman, withered and shrivelled up, and with a hideous face, to whom be related the reason that had brought him to that country.", "The old woman was beside herself with amazement when she heard the strange whim and the fanciful chimera of the prince, and the toils and perils he had gone through to satisfy himself; then she said to him, \"Hasten away, my son!", "for if my three daughters meet you, I would not give a farthing for your life; half alive and half roasted, a frying-pan would be your bier and a belly your grave.", "But away with you as fast as a hare!", "and you will not go far before you find what you are seeking.\"", "When the prince heard this, frightened, terrified and aghast, he set off running at full speed, and ran till he came to another country, where he again met an old woman, more ugly even than the \ufb01rst, to whom he told all his story.", "Then the old woman said to him in like manner, \"Away with you!", "unless you wish to serve for a breakfast to the little ogresses my daughters; but go straight on, and you will soon \ufb01nd what you want.\"", "The prince, hearing this, set off running as fast as a dog with a kettle at its tail; and he went on and on, until he met another old woman, who was sitting upon a wheel, with a basket full of little pies and sweetmeats on her arm, and feeding a number of jackasses, which thereupon began leaping about on the bank of a river and kicking at some poor swans.", "When the prince came up to the old woman, after making a hundred salaamsLiccaralemme\u2014the Alecum-salam or salutation of the Arabs., be related to her the story of his wanderings; whereupon the old woman, comforting him with kind words, gave him such a good breakfast that he licked his fingers after it.", "And when he had done eating, she gave him three citrons, which seemed to be just fresh gathered from the tree; and she gave him also a beautiful knife, saying, \"You are now free to return to Italy, for your labour is ended, and you have what you were seeking.", "Go your way therefore, and when you are near your own kingdom, stop at the first fountain you come to and cut a citron.", "Then a fairy will come forth from it, and will say to you, 'Give me to drink!'", "Mind and be ready with the water, or she will vanish like quicksilver.", "But if you are not quick enough with the second fairy, have your eyes open and be watchful that the third does not escape you, giving her quickly to drink, and you shall have a wife after your own heart.\"", "The prince, overjoyed, kissed the old woman's hairy hand a hundred times, which seemed just like a hedgehog's back.", "Then taking his leave he left that country, and coming to the seashore sailed for the Pillars of Hercules, and arrived at our Sea; and after a thousand storms and perils, he entered port a day's distance from his own kingdom.", "There he came to a most beautiful grove, where the Shades formed a palace for the  , to prevent their being seen by the Sun; and dismounting at a fountain, which with a crystal tongue was inviting the people to refresh their lips, he seated himself on a Syrian carpet formed by the plants and flowers.", "Then he drew his knife from the sheath and began to cut the first citron, when lo!", "there appeared like a flash of lightning a most beautiful maiden, white as milk and red as a strawberry, who said, \"Give me to drink!\"", "The prince was so amazed, bewildered and captivated with the beauty of the fairy, that he did not give her the water quickly enough, so she appeared and vanished at one and the same moment.", "Whether this was a rap on the prince's head, let any one judge who, after longing for a thing, gets it into his hands and instantly loses it again.", "Then the prince cut the second citron, and the same thing happened again; and this was a second blow he got on his pate; so making two little fountains of his eyes, he wept, face to face, tear for tear, drop for drop, with the fountain, and sighing he exclaimed, \"Good heavens, how is it that I am so unfortunate?", "twice I have let her escape, as if my hands were tied; and here I sit like a rock, when I ought to run like a greyhound.", "Faith indeed I have made a fine hand of it!", "But courage, man!", "there is still another, and three is the lucky numberIn the original, A le ttr\u00e8 vence lo Rr\u00e8.; either this knife shall give me the fay, or it shall take my life away.\"", "So saying he cut the third citron, and forth came the third fairy, who said like the others, \"Give me to drink!\"", "Then the prince instantly handed her the water, and behold there stood before him a delicate maiden, white as a junket with red streaks, who looked like an Abruzzi ham or a Nola sausage,\u2014a thing never before seen in the world, with a beauty without compare, a fairness beyond the beyonds, a grace more than the most.", "On that hair Jove had showered down goldAlluding to Danse., of which Love made his shafts to pierce all hearts; that face the god of Love had tinged with red, that some innocent soul should be hung on the gallows of desire; at those eyes the sun had lighted two fireworks, to set fire to the rockets of sighs in the breast of the beholder; to the roses on those lips Venus had given their colour, to wound a thousand enamoured hearts with their thorns; on that breast Juno had shed her milk, to nurture human desires.", "In a word she was so beautiful from head to foot, that a more exquisite creature was never seen.", "The prince knew not what had happened to him, and stood lost in amazement, gazing on such a beautiful offspring of a citron; and he said to himself, \"Are you asleep or awake, Ciommetiello?", "are your eyes bewitched, or are you blind?", "What fair white creature is this come forth from a   rind?", "what sweet dough, from the sour juice of a citron?", "what lovely maiden sprung from a citron-pip?\"", "At length, seeing that it was all true and no dream, he embraced the fairy, giving her a hundred and a hundred kisses; and after a thousand tender words had passed between them\u2014words which, as a cantofermo, had an accompaniment of sugared kisses\u2014the prince said, \"My soul, I cannot take you to my father's kingdom without handsome raiment worthy of so beautiful a person, and an attendance befitting a queen: therefore climb up into this oak-tree, where Nature seems purposely to have made for us a hiding\u2014place in the form of a little room, and here await my return; for I will come back on wings, before a tear can dry, with dresses and servants, and carry you off to my kingdom.\"", "So saying, after the usual ceremonies he departed.", "Now a black slave, who was sent by her mistress with a pitcher to fetch water, came to that well, and seeing by chance the re\ufb02ection of the fairy in the water, she thought it was herself, and exclaimed in amazement, \"Poor Lucia, what do I see?", "me", "so pretty and fair, and mistress send me here!", "No, me will no longer bear.\"", "So saying she broke the pitcher and returned home; and when her mistress asked her, \"Why have you done this mischief?\" she replied, \"Me go to the well alone, pitcher break upon a stone.\"", "Her   swallowed this idle story, and the next day she gave her a pretty little cask, telling her to go and fill it with water.", "So the slave returned to the fountain, and seeing again the beautiful image re\ufb02ected in the water, she said with a deep sigh, \"Me no ugly slave, me no broad-foot goose!", "but pretty and fine as mistress mine, and me not go to the fountain!\"", "So saying, smash again!", "she broke the cask into seventy pieces, and returned grumbling home, and said to her mistress, \"Ass come past, tub fell, down at the well, and all was broken in pieces.\"", "The poor mistress, on hearing this, could contain herself no longer, and seizing a broomstick she beat the slave so soundly that she felt it for many days; then giving her a leather bag, she said, \"Run, break your neck, you wretched slave, you grasshopper-legs, you black beetle!", "run and fetch me this bag full of water, or else I'll hang you like a polyp and give you a good thrashing.\"", "Away ran the slave heels over head, for she had seen the flash and dreaded the thunder; and while she was filling the leather bag, she turned to look again at the beautiful image, and said, \"Me fool to fetch water!", "better live by one's wits: such a pretty girl indeed to serve a bad mistress!\"", "So saying, she took a large pin which she wore in her hair, and began to prick holes in the leather bag, which looked like an open place in a garden with the rose of a watering-potCo l'acqua a trademiento.", "making a hundred little fountains.", "When the fairy saw this she laughed outright; and the slave hearing her, turned and espied her hiding-place up in the tree; whereat she said to herself, \"O ho!", "you make me be beaten?", "but never mind!\"", "Then she said to her, \"What you doing up there, pretty lass?\"", "And the fairy, who was the very mother of courtesy, told her all she knew, and all that had passed with the prince, whom she was expecting from hour to hour and from moment to moment, with fine dresses and servants, to take her with him to his father's kingdom, where they should live happy together.", "When the slave, who was full of spite, heard this, she thought to herself that she would get this prize into her own hands; so she answered the fairy, \"You expect your husband,\u2014me come up and comb your locks, and make you more smart.\"", "And the fairy said, \"Ay, welcome as the \ufb01rst of May!\"", "So the slave climbed up the tree, and the fairy held out her white hand to her, which looked in the black paws of the slave like a crystal mirror in a frame of ebony.", "But no sooner did the slave begin to comb the fairy's locks, than she suddenly stuck a hair-pin into her head.", "Then the fairy, feeling herself pricked, cried out, \"Dove, dove!\"", "and instantly she became a dove and flew away; whereupon the slave stripped herself, and making a bundle of all the rags that she had worn, she threw them a mile away: and there she sat, up in the tree, looking like a statue of jet in a house of emerald.", "In a short time the prince returned with a great cavalcade, and finding a cask of caviar where he had left a pan of milk, he stood for awhile beside himself with amazement.", "At length he said, \"Who has made this great blot of ink on the fine paper upon which I thought to write the brightest days of my life?", "Who has hung with mourning this newly whitewashed house, where I thought to spend a happy life?", "How comes it that I find this touchstone, where I left a mine of silver, that was to make me rich and happy?\"", "But the crafty slave, observing the prince's amazement, said, \"Do not wonder, my prince; for me turned by a wicked spell from a white lily to a black coal.\"", "The poor prince, seeing that there was no help for the mischief, drooped his head and swallowed this pill; and bidding the slave come down from the tree, he ordered her to be clothed from head to foot in new dresses.", "Then sad and sorrowful, cast-down and woebegone, he took his way back with the slave to his own country, where the king and queen, who had gone out six mile to meet them, received them with the same pleasure as a prisoner feels at the announcement of a sentence of Suspendaturi.e.", "'Let him be hanged.\u2019, seeing the fine choice their foolish son had made, who after travelling about so long to find a white dove had brought home at last a black crow.", "However, as they could do no less, they gave up the crown to their children, and placed the golden tripod upon that face of coal.", "Now whilst they were preparing splendid feasts and banquets, and the cooks were busy plucking geese, killing little pigs, flaying kids, basting the roast-meat, skimming pots, mincing meat for dumplings, larding capons, and preparing a thousand other delicacies, a beautiful dove came flying to the kitchen window, and said,", "\"O cook of the kitchen, tell me, I pray,", "What the king and the slave are doing today.\"", "The cook at first paid little heed to the dove; but when she returned a second and a third time, and repeated the same words, he ran to the dining-hall to tell the marvellous thing.", "But no sooner did the lady hear this music, than she gave orders for the dove to be instantly caught and made into a hash.", "So the cook went, and he managed to catch the dove, and did all that the slave had commanded.", "And having scalded the bird, in order to pluck it, he threw the water with the feathers out from a balcony on to a garden-bed, on which before three days had passed there sprung up a beautiful citron-tree, which quickly grew to its full size.", "Now it happened that the king, going by chance to a window that looked upon the garden, saw the tree, which he had never observed before; and calling the cook, he asked him when and by whom it had been planted.", "No sooner had he heard all the particulars from Master Pot-ladle, than he began to suspect how matters stood; so he gave orders, under pain of death, that the tree should not be touched, but that it should be tended with the greatest care.", "At the end of a few days three most beautiful citrons appeared, similar to those which the ogress had given Ciommetiello; and when they were grown larger, he plucked them; and shutting himself up in a chamber, with a large basin of water and the knife which he always carried at his side, he began to cut the citrons.", "Then it all fell out with the first and second fairy just as it had done before; but when at last he cut the third citron, and gave the fairy who came forth from it to drink, behold there stood before him the self-same maiden whom he had left up in the tree, and who told him all the mischief that the slave had done.", "Who now can tell the least part of the delight the king felt at this good turn of fortune?", "Who can describe the shouting and leaping for joy that there was?", "for the king was swimming in a sea of delight, and was wafted to heaven on a tide of rapture.", "Then he embraced the fairy, and ordered her to be handsomely drest from head to foot; and taking her by the hand he led her into the middle of the hall, where all the courtiers and great folks of the city were met to celebrate the feast.", "Then the king called on them one by one, and said, \"Tell me, what punishment would that person deserve who should do any harm to this beautiful lady?\"", "And one replied that such a person would deserve a hempen collar\u2014another, a breakfast of stones\u2014a third, a good beating on his stomach\u2014a fourth, a draught of scammony\u2014a fifth, a millstone for a brooch; in short, one said this thing and another that.", "At last he called on the black queen, and putting the same question, she replied, \"Such a person would deserve to be burned, and that her ashes should be thrown from the roof of the castle.\"", "When the king heard this he said to her, \"You have struck your own foot with the axe, you have made your own fetters, you have sharpened the knife and mixed the poison, for no one has done this lady so much harm as yourself, you good-for-nothing creature!", "Know you that this is the beautiful maiden whom you wounded with the hair-pin?", "Know you that this is the pretty dove which you ordered to be killed and cooked in a stewpan?", "What say you now?", "it is all your own doing, and one who does ill may expect ill in return.\"", "So saying he ordered the slave to be seized and cast alive on to a large burning pile of wood, and her ashes were thrown from the top of the castle to all the winds of heaven, verifying the truth of the saying, that", "\"He who sows thorns should not go barefoot.\"", "All sat listening attentively to Ciommetella's story; and some praised the skill with which she had related it, whilst others murmured at her indiscretion, saying that she ought not in the presence of the Princess slave to have exposed to blame the ill deeds of another slave, and run the risk of stopping the game.", "But Lucia sat upon thorns, and kept turning and twisting herself about all the time the story was related; insomuch that the restlessness of her body betrayed the storm which was in her heart, at seeing in the history of another slave the exact image of her own tricks.", "Gladly would she have dismissed the whole company, but that, owing to the desire which the doll had given her to hear stories, she could no more do without them than a man bitten by a tarantula can dispense with music; and partly also not to give Taddeo cause for suspicion, she swallowed this bitter pill, intending to take a good revenge in proper time and place.", "But Taddeo, who had grown quite fond of this amusement, made a sign to Zoza to relate her story, and after making her curtsey she began"], "bn_03550932n": ["Truly the wise man said well, that a command of gall cannot be obeyed like one of sugar.", "A man must require just and reasonable things, if he would see the

woman as beautiful as I have been; otherwise I leave you my curse, and shall bear you hatred even in the other world.\"", "The king, who loved his wife beyond measure, hearing this her last wish, burst into tears, and for some time could not answer a single word.", "At last, when he had done weeping, he said to her, \"Sooner than take another wife, may the gout lay hold on me, may I have my head cut off like a mackarelSia fatto comm' a starace.", "A starace is a fish, which ia eaten with ita head pulled off.!", "My dearest love, drive such a thought from your mind; do not believe in dreams, or that I could love any other woman; you were the first new coat of my love, and you shall carry away with you the last rags of my affection.\"", "As he said these words, the poor young queen, who had the death-rattle in her throat, turned up her eyes and stretched out her feet.", "When the king saw her life thus running out, he unstopped the channels of his eyes, and made such a howling and beating and outcry, that all the Court came running up, calling on the name of the dear soul, and upbraiding Fortune for taking her from him; and plucking out his beard, he cursed the stars, that had sent him such a misfortune.", "But bearing in mind the maxim, \"Pain in one's elbow and pain for one's wife are alike hard to bear, but are soon over,\" ere the Night had gone forth into the place-of-arms in the sky to muster the bats, he began to count upon his fingers and to reflect thus to himself: \"Here is my wife dead, and I am left a wretched widower, with no hope of seeing any one but this poor daughter whom she has left me.", "I must therefore try to discover some means or other of having a son and heir.", "But where shall I look?", "where shall I find a woman equal in beauty to my wife?", "every one appears a witch in comparison with her; where then shall I find another with a bit of stick, or seek another with the bellAs children hunt for anything lost in

let me open eyes and ears and look about: may there not be some other she-ass in Nardella's stable?", "is it possible that the world should be lost to me?", "is there such a dearth of women, or is the race extinct?\"", "So saying he forthwith issued a proclamation and command by Master Chiommiento, that all the handsome women in the world should come to the   of beauty, for he would take the most beautiful to wife and endow her with a kingdom.", "Now when this news was spread abroad, there was not a woman in the universe who did not come to try her luck,\u2014not a witch, however ugly, who staid behind; for when it is a question of beauty, no scullion-wench will acknowledge herself surpassed, no sea-ork will yield: every one piques herself on being the handsomest; and if the looking-glass tells her the truth, she blames the glass for being untrue, and the quicksilver for being put on badly.", "When the town was thus filled with women, the king had them all drawn up in a line; and he walked up and down, from top to bottom, like a baboon that is never still; and as he examined and measured each from head to foot, one appeared to him wry-browed, another long-nosed, another broad-mouthed, another thick-lipped, another tall as a maypole, another short and dumpy, another too stout, another too slender; the Spaniard did not please him on account of her dark colour, the Neapolitan was not to his fancy on account of her waddling gait, the German appeared cold and icy, the Frenchwoman frivolous and giddy, the Venetian with her light hair looked like a distaff of flax.", "At the end of the end, one for this cause and another for that, he sent them all away, with one hand before and the other behind; and seeing that so many fair faces were all show and no wool, he turned his thoughts to his own daughter, saying, \"Why do I go seeking Maria at Ravenna, when my daughter Preziosa is formed in the same mould of beauty as her mother?", "I have this fair face here in my house, and yet go looking for it at the fag-end of the world.\"", "When Preziosa heard this, she retired to her chamber, and bewailing her ill fortune, she did not leave a hair upon her head;

her grief, the old woman said to her, \"Cheer up, my daughter; do not despair; there is a remedy for every evil save death.", "Now listen: if your father speaks to you thus once again, put this bit of wood into your mouth, and instantly you will be changed into a she-bear; then off with you!", "for in his fright he will let you depart; and go straight to the wood, where Heaven has kept good-fortune in store for you since the day you were born: and whenever you wish to appear a woman, as you are and will remain, only take the piece of wood out of your mouth, and you will return to your true form.\"", "Then Preziosa embraced the old woman, and giving her a good apronful of meal, and ham and bacon, sent her away.", "As soon as the Sun began to change his quarters, the king ordered the musicians to come; and inviting all his lords and vassals he held a great feast.", "And after dancing for five or six hours, they all sat down to table, and ate and drank beyond measure.", "Then the king asked his courtiers whether he could not marry Preziosa, as she was the picture of his dead wife.", "But the instant Preziosa heard this, she slipped the bit of wood into her mouth, and took the figure of a terrible she-bear; at the sight of which all present were frightened out of their wits, and ran off as fast as they could scamper.", "Meanwhile Preziosa went out, and took her way to a wood, where the Shades were holding a consultation how they might do some mischief to the Sun at the close of day.", "And there she staid, in the pleasant companionship of the other animals, until the son of the king of Running-Water came to hunt in that part of the country, who at the sight of the bear had like to have died on the spot.", "But when he saw the beast come gently up to him, wagging her tail like a little dog and rubbing her sides against him, he took courage, and patted her, and said, \"Good bear, good bear!", "there, there!", "poor beast, poor beast!\"", "Then he led her home, and ordered that she should be taken good care of; and he had her put into a garden close to the royal palace, that he might see her from the window whenever he wished.", "One day, when all the people of the house were gone out, and the prince was left alone, he went to the window to look out at the bear; and there he beheld Preziosa, who had taken the piece of wood out of her mouth, combing her golden tresses.", "At the sight of this beauty, which was beyond the beyonds, he had like to have lost his senses with amazement, and tumbling down the stairs he ran out into the garden.", "But Preziosa, who was on the watch and observed him, popped the piece of wood into her mouth, and was instantly changed into a bear again.", "When the prince came down and looked about in vain for Preziosa, whom he had seen from the window above, he was so amazed at the trick that a deep melancholy came over him, and in four days he fell sick, crying continually, \"My bear, my bear!\"", "His mother, hearing him wailing thus, imagined that the bear had done him some hurt, and gave orders that she should be killed.", "But the servants, enamoured of the tameness of the bear, who made herself beloved by the very stones in the road, took pity on her, and, instead of killing her, they led her to the wood, and told the queen that they had put an end to her.", "When this came to the ears of the prince, he acted in a way to pass belief; ill or well he jumped out of bed, and was going at once to make mincemeat of the servants.", "But when they told him the truth of the affair, he jumped on horseback, half-dead as he was, and went rambling about and seeking everywhere, until at length he found the bear.", "Then he took her home again, and putting her into a chamber said to her, \"O lovely morsel for a king who art shut up in this skin!", "O candle of love, who art enclosed within this hairy lanthorn!", "wherefore all this trifling?", "do you wish to see me pine and pant, and die by inches?", "I am wasting away, without hope, and tormented by thy beauty; and you see clearly the proof, for I am shrunk two-thirds in size, like wine boiled down, and am nothing but skin and bone, for the fever is double-stitched to my veins.", "So lift up the curtain of this hairy hide, and let me gaze upon the spectacle of thy beauty!", "raise, O raise the leaves off this basket, and let me get a sight of the fine fruit beneath!", "lift up that curtain, and let my eyes pass in to behold the pomp of wonders!", "Who has shut up so smooth a creature in a prison woven of hair?", "who has locked up so rich a treasure in a leathern chest?", "Let me behold this display of graces, and take in payment all my love; for nothing but this bear's-grease can cure the nervous spasms I endure.\"", "But when he had said and had said, this and a great deal more, and still saw that all his words were thrown away, he took to his bed again, and had such a   fit that the doctors prognosticated badly of his case.", "Then his mother, who had no other joy in the world, sat down by his bedside, and said to him, \"My son, whence comes all this grief?", "what melancholy humour has seized you?", "you are young, you are loved, you are great, you are rich,\u2014what then is it you want, my son?", "speak\u2014a bashful beggar carries an empty bag.", "If you want a wife, only choose, and I will bring the match about; do you take, and I'll pay.", "Do you not see that your illness is an illness to me?", "your pulse beats with fever in your veins, and my heart beats with illness in my brain, for I have no other support of my old-age than you.", "So be cheerful now, and cheer up my heart, and do not see the whole kingdom thrown into mourning, this house into lamentation, and your mother forlorn and heart-broken.\"", "When the prince heard these words, he said, \"Nothing can console me but the sight of the bear; therefore, if you wish to see me well again, let her be brought into this chamber: I will have no one else to attend me, and make my bed, and cook for me, but she herself; and you may be sure that this pleasure will make me well in a trice.\"", "Thereupon his mother, although she thought it ridiculous enough for the bear to act as cook and chambermaid, and feared that her son was not in his right mind, yet, in order to gratify him, had the bear fetched.", "And when the bear came up to the prince's bed, she raised her paw, and felt the patient's pulse; which made the queen laugh outright, for she thought every moment that the bear would scratch his nose.", "Then the prince said, \"My dear bear, will you not cook for me, and give me my food, and wait upon me?\" and the bear nodded her head, to show that she accepted the office.", "Then his mother had some fowls brought, and a fire lighted on the hearth in the same chamber, and some water set to boil; whereupon the bear laying hold on a fowl, scalded and plucked it handily, and drew it, and then stuck one portion of it on the spit, and with the other part she made such a delicious hash, that the prince, who could not relish even sugar, licked his fingers at the taste.", "And when he had done eating, the bear handed him drink with such grace, that the queen was ready to kiss her on her forehead.", "Thereupon the prince arose, and the bear quickly set about making the bed; and running into the garden, she gathered a clothful of roses and citron-flowers, and strewed them over it, so that the queen said the bear was worth her weight in gold, and that her son had good reason to be so fond of her.", "But when the prince saw these pretty offices, they only added fuel to the fire; and if before he wasted by ounces, he now melted away by pounds; and he said to the queen, \"My lady mother, if I do not give this bear a kiss, the breath will leave my body.\"", "Whereupon the queen, seeing him fainting away, said, \"Kiss him, kiss him, my beautiful beast!", "let me not see my poor son die of longing.\"", "Then the bear went up to the prince, and taking him by the cheeksPigliatala a pezzechille.", "A common practice at Naples in kissing is to nip the person on each cheek at the same time with finger and thumb.", "kissed him again and again.", "Meanwhile (I know not how it was) the piece of wood slipped out of Preziosa's mouth, and she remained in the arms of the prince the most beautiful creature in the world; and pressing her to his heart he said, \"I have caught you, my little rogue!", "you shall not escape from me again without a good reason.\"", "At these words Preziosa, adding the colour of modesty to the picture of her natural beauty, said to him, \"I am indeed in your hands,\u2014only guard my honour, and take me where you will.\"", "Then the queen inquired who the beautiful maiden was, and what had brought her to this savage life; and Preziosa related the whole story of her misfortunes, at which the queen, praising her as a good and virtuous girl, told her son that she was content that Preziosa should be his wife.", "Then the prince, who desired nothing else in life, forthwith pledged her his faith; and the mother giving them her blessing, this happy marriage was celebrated with great feasting and illuminations, and Preziosa experienced the truth of the saying, that", "\"One who acts well may always expect good.\"", "When Antonella's story was ended, it was loudly applauded as beautiful and charming, and offering a good example of a virtuous maiden.", "And now Ciulla's turn being come, she began as follows"], "bn_03729159n": ["It has always been more difficult for a man to keep than to get; for in the one case fortune aids, which often assists injustice, but in the other case sense is required.", "Therefore we frequently find a person deficient in cleverness rise to wealth, and then, from want of sense, roll head over heels to the bottom; as you will see clearly from the story I am going to tell you, if you are quick of understanding.", "A merchant once had an only daughter, whom he wished greatly to see married; but as often as he struck this note, he found her a hundred miles off from the desired pitch; for the foolish girl would never consent to marry, and the father was in consequence the most unhappy and miserable man in the world.", "Now it happened one day that he was going to a fair; so he asked his daughter, who was named Betta, what she would like him to bring her on his return.", "And she said, \"Papa, if you love me, bring me half a hundredweight of Palermo sugar, and as much again of sweet almonds, with four to six bottles of scented water, and a little musk and amber, also forty pearls, two sapphires, a few garnets and rubies, with some gold thread, and above all a trough and a little silver trowel.\"", "Her father wondered at this extravagant demand; nevertheless he would not refuse his daughter; so he went to the fair, and on his return brought her all that she had requested.", "As soon as Betta received these things, she shut herself up in a chamber, and began to make a great quantity of paste of almonds and sugar, mixed with rose-water and perfumes, and set to work to form a most beautiful youth, making his hairs of gold thread, his eyes of sapphires, his teeth of pearls, his lips of rubies; and she gave him such grace, that speech alone was wanting to him.", "When she had done all this, having heard say that at the prayers of a certain king of CyprusPygmalion.", "a statue had once come to life, she prayed to the goddess of Love so long that at last the statue began to open its eyes; and increasing her prayers, it began to breathe; and after breathing, words came out; and at last disengaging all its limbs, it began to walk.", "With a joy far greater than if she had gained a  , Betta embraced and kissed the youth, and taking him by the hand she led him before her father, and said, \"My lord and father, you have always told me that you wished to see me married, and in order to please you I have now chosen a husband after my own heart.\"", "When her father saw the handsome youth come out of his daughter's room, whom he had not seen enter it, he stood amazed, and at the sight of such beauty, which folks would have paid a halfpenny ahead to gaze at, he consented that the marriage should take place.", "So a great feast was made, at which, among the other ladies present, there appeared a great unknown queen, who seeing the beauty of Pintosmalto (for that was the name Betta gave him), fell desperately in love with him.", "Now Pintosmalto, who had only opened his eyes on the wickedness of the world three hours before, and was as innocent as a babe, accompanied the strangers who had come to celebrate his nuptials to the stairs, as his bride had told him; and when he did the same with this queen, she took him by the hand and led him quietly to her coach, drawn by six horses, which stood in the courtyard; then taking him into it, she ordered the coachman to drive off and away to her country, where the simple Pintosmalto, not knowing what had happened, became her husband.", "After Betta had waited awhile, in vain expecting   to return, she sent down into the courtyard to see whether he were speaking with any one there; then she sent up on to the roof, to see if he had gone to take fresh air; but finding him nowhere, she directly imagined that, on account of his great beauty, he had been stolen from her.", "So she ordered the usual proclamations to be made; but at last, as no tidings of him were brought, she formed the resolution to go all the world over in search of him; and dressing herself as a poor girl, she set out on her way.", "After some months she came to the house of a good old woman, who received her with great kindness; and when she had heard Betta's misfortune, she took compassion on her, and taught her three sayings: the first was, \"Tricche varlacche, the house rains!\"", "the second, \"Anola tranola, the fountain plays!\"", "the third, \"Scatola matola, the sun shines\"\u2014telling her to repeat these words whenever she was in trouble, and they would be of good service to her.", "Betta wondered greatly at this present of chaff; nevertheless she said to herself, \"He who blows into your mouthTo restore breath to a person.", "does not wish to see you dead, and the plant that strikes root does not wither; everything has its use; who knows what good fortune may be contained in these words?\"", "So saying, she thanked the old woman, and set out upon her way.", "And after a long journey she came to a beautiful city called Round-Mount, where she went straight to the royal palace, and begged for the love of Heaven a little shelter in the stable.", "So the ladies of the court ordered a small room to be given her on the stairs; and while poor Betta was sitting there, she saw Pintosmalto pass by, whereat her joy was so great that she was on the point of slipping down from the tree of life.", "But seeing the trouble she was in, Betta wished to make proof of the first saying which the old woman had told her; and no sooner had she repeated the words, \"Tricche varlacche, the house rains,\" than instantly there appeared before her a beautiful little coach of gold set all over with jewels, which ran about the chamber of itself and was a wonder to behold.", "When the ladies of the court saw this sight, they went and told the queen, who without loss of time ran to Betta's chamber; and when she saw the beautiful little coach, she asked her whether she would sell it, and offered to give whatever she might demand.", "But Betta replied that, although she was poor, she would not sell it for all the gold in the world; but if the queen wished for the little coach, she must allow her to pass one night at the door of her husband's chamber.", "The queen was amazed at the folly of the poor girl, who although she was all in rags would nevertheless give up such riches for a mere whim; however she resolved to take the good mouthful offered her, and, by giving Pintosmalto a sleeping-draught, to satisfy the poor girl but pay her in bad coin.", "As soon as the Night was come, when the stars in the sky and the glowworms on the earth were to pass in review, the queen gave a sleeping-draught to Pintosmalto, who did everything he was told, and sent him to bed.", "And no sooner had he thrown himself on the mattress, than he fell as sound asleep as a dormouse.", "Poor Betta, who thought that night to relate all her past troubles, seeing now that she had no audience, fell to lamenting beyond measure, blaming herself for all that she had done for his sake; and the unhappy girl never closed her mouth, nor did the sleeping Pintosmalto ever open his eyes, until the Sun appeared with the aqua regia of his rays to separate the shades from the light, when the queen came down, and taking Pintosmalto by the hand said to Betta, \"Now be content.\"", "\"May you have such content all the days of your life!\" replied Betta in an under tone; \"for I have passed so bad a night that I shall not soon forget it.\"", "The poor girl however could not resist her longing, and resolved to make trial of the second saying: so she repeated the words, \"Anola tranola, the fountain plays!\"", "and instantly there appeared a golden cage, with a beautiful bird made of precious stones and gold, which sang like a nightingale.", "When the ladies saw this, they went and told it to the queen, who wished to see the bird; then she asked the same question as about the little coach, and Betta made the same reply as before; whereupon the queen, who perceived, as she thought, what a silly creature Betta was, promised to grant her request, and took the cage with the bird.", "And as soon as night came, she gave Pintosmalto a sleeping-draught as before, and sent him to bed.", "When Betta saw that he slept like a dead person, she began again to wail and lament, saying things that would have moved a flint-stone to compassion; and thus she passed another night, full of trouble, weeping and wailing and tearing her hair.", "But as soon as it was day, the queen came to fetch her husband, and left poor Betta in grief and sorrow, and biting her hands with vexation at the trick that had been played her.", "In the morning, when Pintosmalto went to a garden outside the city-gate to pluck some figs, he met a cobbler, who lived in a room close to where Betta lay, and had not lost a word of all she had said.", "Then he told Pintosmalto of the weeping, lamentation and crying of the unhappy beggar-girl; and when  , who already began to get a little more sense, heard this, he guessed how matters stood, and resolved that, if the same thing happened again, he would not drink what the queen gave him.", "Betta now wished to make the third trial; so she said the words, \"Scatola matola, the sun shines!\"", "and instantly there appeared a quantity of stuffs of silk and gold, and embroidered scarfs, with a golden cup; in short the queen herself could not have brought together so many beautiful ornaments.", "When the ladies saw these things, they told their mistress, who endeavoured to obtain them as she had done the others; but Betta replied as before, that if the queen wished to have them she must let her spend the night at the door of the chamber.", "Then the queen said to herself, \"What can I lose by satisfying this silly girl, in order to get from her these beautiful things?\"", "So taking all the treasures which Betta offered her, as soon as Night appeared, the instrument for the debt contracted with Sleep and Repose being liquidated, she gave the sleeping-draught to Pintosmalto; but this time he did not swallow it, and making an excuse to leave the room, he spat it out again, and then went to bed.", "Betta now began to the same tune again, saying how she had kneaded him with her own hands of sugar and almonds, how she had made his hair of gold, and his eyes and mouth of pearls and precious stones, and how he was indebted to her for his life, which the gods had granted to her prayers, and lastly how he had been stolen from her, and she had gone seeking him with such toil and trouble.", "Then she went on to tell him how she had watched two nights at the door of his room, and, for leave to do so, had given up two treasures, and yet had not been able to hear a single word from him, so that this was the last night of her hopes and the conclusion of her life.", "When Pintosmalto, who had remained awake, heard these words, and called to mind as a dream all that had passed, he rose and embraced her; and as Night had just come forth with her black mask to direct the dance of the Stars, he went very quietly, into the chamber of the queen, who was in a deep sleep, and took from her all the things that she had taken from Betta, and all the jewels and money which were in a desk, to repay himself for his past troubles.", "Then returning to his wife, they set off that very hour, and travelled on and on until they arrived at her father's house, where they found him alive and well; and from the joy of seeing his daughter again he became like a boy of fifteen years.", "But when the queen found neither husband, nor beggar-girl, nor jewels, she tore her hair and rent her clothes, and called to mind the saying,", "\"He who cheats must not complain if he be cheated.\"", "More than one of those present would have given a finger to have had the power of making a husband or a wife at pleasure,\u2014especially the Prince, who would then have seen a paste of sugar at his side, where he now had a mass of poison.", "But it being Tolla's turn to carry on the game, she did not wait for an execution to make her pay the debt, but spoke as follows"], "bn_03980496n": ["There was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old, who was so handsome and loveable that no one could look at him without liking him, and she herself worshipped him above everything in the world.", "Now it so happened that he suddenly became ill, and God took him to himself; and for this the mother could not be comforted, and wept both day and night.", "But soon afterwards, when the child had been buried, it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and played during its life, and if the mother wept, it wept also, and when morning came it disappeared.", "As, however, the mother would not stop crying, it came one night, in the little white shroud in which it had been laid in its coffin, and with its wreath of flowers round its head, and stood on the bed at her feet, and said, \"Oh, mother, do stop crying, or I shall never fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud will not dry because of all thy tears, which fall upon it.\"", "The mother was afraid when she heard that, and wept no more.", "The next night the child came again, and held a little light in its hand, and said, \"Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my grave.\"", "Then the mother gave her sorrow into God's keeping, and bore it quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in its little bed beneath the earth.", "There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly: he was every morning the first out of bed, and the last to go to rest at night; and, whenever there was a difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he was always the first to set himself to it.", "Moreover, he never complained, but was contented with everything, and always merry.", "When the third year also was past, the master considered, put his hand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out.", "Then at last the servant said, \"Master, for three years I have served you honestly, be so good as to give me what I ought to have; for I wish to leave, and look about me a little more in the world.\"", "\"Yes, my good fellow,\" answered the old miser; \"you have served me industriously, and, therefore, you shall be cheerfully rewarded;\" and he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three farthings, saying, \"There, you have a farthing for each year; that is large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from few masters.\"", "The honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought, \"Ah! now that I have my purse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work!\"", "So on he went, up hill and down dale; and sang and jumped to his heart's content.", "Now it came to pass that as he was going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to himy \"Whither away, merry brother?", "I see you do not carry many cares.\"", "\"Why should I be sad?\" answered the servant; \"I have enough; three years' wages are jingling in my pocket.\"", "\"How much is your treasure?\"", "the dwarf asked him.", "'How much?", "Three farthings sterling, all told.\"", "\"Look here,\" said the dwarf, \"I am a poor needy man, give me your three farthings; I can work no longer, but you are young, and can easily earn your bread.\"", "And as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the old man, he gave him the three farthings, saying, \"Take them in the name of Heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it.\"", "Then the little man said, \"As I see you have a good \"Aha?\" said the servant, \"you are one of those who can work wonders!", "Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for a gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at; secondly, for a fiddle, which when I play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance; thirdly, that if I ask a favour of any one he shall not be able to refuse it.\"", "\"All that shall you have,\" said the dwarf; and put his hand into the bush, and only think, there lay a fiddle and gun, all ready, just as if they had been ordered.", "These he gave to the servant, and then said to him, \" Whatever you may ask at any time, no man in the world shall be able to deny you.\"", "\"Heart alive!", "What can one desire more?\" said the servant to himself, and went merrily onwards.", "Soon afterwards he met a Jew with a long goat's-beard, who was standing listening to the song of a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree.", "\"Good heavens,\" he was exclaiming, \"that such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice!", "if it were but mine!", "if only some one would sprinkle some salt upon its tail!\"", "\"If that is all,\" said the servant, \"the bird shall soon be down here;\" and taking aim he pulled the trigger, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.", "\"Go, you rogue,\" he said to the Jew, \"and fetch the bird out for yourself!\"", "\"Oh!\" said the Jew, \"leave out the rogue, my master, and I will do it at once.", "I will get the bird out for myself, as you really have hit it.\"", "Then he lay down on the ground, and began to crawl into the thicket.", "When he was fast among the thorns, the good servant's humour so tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play.", "In a moment the Jew's legs began to move, and to jump into the air, and the more the servant fiddled the better went the dance.", "But the thorns tore his shabby coat for him, combed his beard, and pricked and plucked him all over the body.", "\"Oh dear,\" cried the Jew, \"what do I want with your fiddling?", "leave the fiddle alone, master; I do not want to dance.\"", "But the servant did not listen to him, and thought, The Jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was far off and out of sight,

ragamuffin!", "just put five farthings in your mouth, and then you may be worth three halfpence!\" and went on abusing him as fast as he could speak.", "As soon as he had refreshed himself a little in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town to the justice.", "\"My lord judge,\" he said, \"I have come to make a complaint; see how a rascal has robbed and ill-treated me on the public highway!", "a stone on the ground might pity me; my clothes all torn, my body pricked and scratched, my little all gone with my purse,\u2014good ducats, each piece better than the last; for God's sake let the man be thrown into prison!\"", "\"Was it a soldier,\" said the judge, \"who cut you thus with his sabre?\"", "\"Nothing of the sort!\" said the Jew; \"it was no sword that he had, but a gun

along, and they found, too, the purse with the money upon him.", "As soon as he was taken before the judge he said, \"I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money; he gave it to me of his own free will, that I might leave off fiddling because he could not bear my music.\"", "But the judge also did not believe his tale, and said, \"This is a bad defence, no Jew would do that.\"", "And because he had committed robbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be hanged.", "As he was being led away the Jew again screamed after him, \"You vagabond!", "you dog of a fiddler!", "now you are going to receive your well-earned reward!\"", "The servant walked quietly with the hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round and said to the judge, \"Grant me just one request before I die.\"", "\"Yes, if you do not ask your life,\" said the judge.", "\"I do not ask for life,\" answered the servant, \"but as a last favour let me play once more upon my fiddle.\"", "The Jew raised a great cry of \"Murder! murder!", "for goodness' sake do not allow it!", "Do not allow it!\"", "But the judge said, \"Why should I not let him have this short pleasure?", "it has been granted to him, and he shall have it.\"", "However, he could not have refused on account of the gift which had been bestowed on the servant.", "Then the Jew cried, \"Oh! woe's me!", "tie me, tie me fast!\"", "while the good servant took his fiddle from his neck, and made ready.", "As he gave the first scrape, they all began to quiver and shake, the judge, his clerk, and the hangman and his men, and the cord fell out of the hand of the one who was going to tie the Jew fast.", "At the second scrape all raised their legs, and the hangman let go his hold of the good servant, and made himself ready to dance.", "At the third scrape they all leaped up and began to dance; the judge and the Jew being the best at jumping.", "Soon all who had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing with them; old and young, fat and lean, one with another.", "The dogs, likewise, which had run there got up on their hind legs and capered about; and the longer he played, the higher sprang the dancers, so that they knocked against each other's heads, and began to shriek terribly.", "At length the judge cried, quite out of breath, \"I will give you your life if you will only stop fiddling.\"", "The good servant thereupon had compassion, took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again, and stepped down the ladder.", "Then he went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground panting for breath, and said, \"You rascal, now confess, whence you got the money, or I will take my fiddle and begin to play again.\"", "\"I stole it, I stole it!\" cried he; \"but you have honestly earned it.\"", "So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief"], "bn_17385267n": ["ONE summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his board near the window, and working

contemptuously, and said, \"You little rascal!", "you miserable fellow!\"", "\"That may be!\" answered the little tailor, and undoing his coat he showed the giant his belt; \"you can read there whether I am a man or not!\"", "The giant read: \"Seven at one blow!\"", "and thinking it meant men that the tailor had killed, felt at once more respect for the little fellow.", "But as he wanted to prove him, he took up a stone and squeezed it so hard that water came out of it.", "\"Now you can do that,\" said the giant,\u2014\"that is, if you have the strength for it.\"", "\"That's not much,\" said the little tailor, \"I call that play,\" and he put his hand in his pocket and took out the cheese and squeezed it, so that the whey ran out of it.", "\"Well,\" said he, \"what do you think of that?\"", "The giant did not know what to say to it, for he could not have believed it of the little man.", "Then the giant took up a stone and threw it so high that it was nearly out of sight.", "\"Now, little fellow, suppose you do that!\"", "\"Well thrown,\" said the tailor; \"but the stone fell back to earth again,\u2014I will throw you one that will never come back.\"", "So he felt in his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.", "And the bird, when it found itself at liberty, took wing, flew off, and returned no more.", "\"What do you think of that, comrade?\" asked the tailor.", "\"There is no doubt that you can throw,\" said the giant; \"but we will see if you can carry.\"", "He led the little tailor to a mighty oak-tree which had been felled, and was lying on the ground, and said, \"Now, if you are strong enough, help me to carry this tree out of the wood.\"", "\"Willingly,\" answered the little man: \"you take the trunk on your shoulders, I will take the branches with all their foliage, that is much the most difficult.\"", "So the giant took the trunk on his shoulders, and the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not see what he was doing, had the whole tree to carry, and the little man on it as well.", "And the little man was very cheerful and merry, and whistled the tune: \"There were three tailors riding by,\" as if carrying the tree was mere child's play.", "The giant, when he had struggled on under his heavy load a part of the way, was tired out, and cried, \"Look here, I must let go the tree!\"", "The tailor jumped off quickly, and taking hold of the tree with both arms, as if he were carrying it, said to the giant, \"You see you can't carry the tree though you are such a big fellow!\"", "They went on together a little farther, and presently they came to a cherry-tree, and the giant took hold of the topmost branches, where the ripest fruit hung, and pulling them downwards, gave them to the tailor to hold, bidding him eat.", "But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and as the giant let go, the tree sprang back, and the tailor was caught up into the air.", "And when he dropped down again without any damage, the giant said to him, \"How is this?", "haven't you strength enough to hold such a weak sprig as that?\"", "\"It is not strength that is lacking,\" answered the little tailor; \"how should it to one who has slain seven at one blow!", "I just jumped over the tree because the hunters are shooting down there in the bushes.", "You jump it too, if you can.\"", "The giant made the attempt, and not being able to vault the tree, he remained hanging in the branches, so that once more the little tailor got the better of him.", "Then said the giant, \"As you are such a gallant fellow, suppose you come with me to our den, and stay the night.\"", "The tailor was quite willing, and he followed him.", "When they reached the den there sat some other giants by the fire, and each had a roasted sheep in his hand, and was eating it.", "The little tailor looked round and thought, \"There is more elbow-room here than in my workshop.\"", "And the giant showed him a bed, and told him he had better lie down upon it and go to sleep.", "The bed was, however, too big for the tailor, so he did not stay in it, but crept into a corner to sleep.", "As soon as it was midnight the giant got up, took a great staff of iron and beat the bed through with one stroke, and supposed he had made an end of that grasshopper of a tailor.", "Very early in the morning the giants went into the wood and forgot all about the little tailor, and when they saw him coming after them alive and merry, they were terribly frightened, and, thinking he was going to kill them, they ran away in all haste.", "So the little tailor marched on, always following his nose.", "And after he had gone a great way he entered the courtyard belonging to a King's palace, and there he felt so overpowered with fatigue that he lay down and fell asleep.", "In the meanwhile came various people, who looked at him very curiously, and read on his belt, \"Seven at one blow!\"", "\"Oh!\" said they, \"why should this great lord come here in time of peace?", "what a mighty champion he must be.\"", "Then they went and told the King about him, and they thought that if war should break out what a worthy and useful man he would be, and that he ought not to be allowed to depart at any price.", "The King then summoned his council, and sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to beg him, so soon as he should wake up, to consent to serve in the King's army.", "So the messenger stood and waited at the sleeper's side until his limbs began to stretch, and his eyes to open, and then he carried his answer back.", "And the answer was, \"That was the reason for which I came,\" said the little tailor, \"I am ready to enter the King's service.\"", "So he was received into it very honourably, and a separate dwelling set apart for him.", "But the rest of the soldiers were very much set against the little tailor, and they wished him a thousand miles away.", "\"What shall be done about it?\"", "they said among themselves; \"if we pick a quarrel and fight with him then seven of us will fall at each blow.", "That will be of no good to us.\"", "So they came to a resolution, and went all together to the King to ask for their discharge.", "\"We never intended,\" said they, \"to serve with a man who kills seven at a blow.\"", "The King felt sorry to lose all his faithful servants because of one man, and he wished that he had never seen him, and would willingly get rid of him if he might.", "But he did not dare to dismiss the little tailor for fear he should kill all the King's people, and place himself upon the throne.", "He thought a long while about it, and at last made up his mind what to do.", "He sent for the little tailor, and told him that as he was so great a warrior he had a proposal to make to him.", "He told him that in a wood in his dominions dwelt two giants, who did great damage by robbery, murder, and fire, and that no man durst go near them for fear of his life.", "But that if the tailor should overcome and slay both these giants the King would give him his only daughter in marriage, and half his kingdom as dowry, and that a hundred horsemen should go with him to give him assistance.", "\"That would be something for a man like me!\"", "thought the little tailor, \"a beautiful princess and half a kingdom are not to be had every day,\" and he said to the King, \"Oh yes, I can soon overcome the giants, and yet have no need of the hundred horsemen; he who can kill seven at one blow has no need to be afraid of two.\"", "So the little tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him.", "When he came to the border of the wood he said to his escort, \"Stay here while I go to attack the giants.\"", "Then he sprang into the wood, and looked about him right and left.", "After a while he caught sight of the two giants; they were lying down under a tree asleep, and snoring so that all the branches shook.", "The little tailor, all alive, filled both his pockets with stones and climbed up into the tree, and made his way to an overhanging bough, so that he could seat himself just above the sleepers; and from there he let one stone after another fall on the chest of one of the giants.", "For a long time the giant was quite unaware of this, but at last he waked up and pushed his comrade, and said, \"What are you hitting me for?\"", "\"You are dreaming,\" said the other, \"I am not touching you.\"", "And they composed themselves again to sleep, and the tailor let fall a stone on the other giant.", "\"What can that be?\" cried he, \"what are you casting at me?\"", "\"I am casting nothing at you,\" answered the first, grumbling.", "They disputed about it for a while, but as they were tired, they gave it up at last, and their eyes closed once more.", "Then the little tailor began his game anew, picked out a heavier stone and threw it down with force upon the first giant's chest.", "\"This is too much!\" cried he, and sprang up like a madman and struck his companion such a blow that the tree shook above them.", "The other paid him back with ready coin, and they fought with such fury that they tore up trees by their roots to use for weapons against each other, so that at last they both of them lay dead upon the ground.", "And now the little tailor got down.", "\"Another piece of luck!\" said he, \"that the tree I was sitting in did not get torn up too, or else I should have had to jump like a squirrel from one tree to another.\"", "Then he drew his sword and gave each of the giants a few hacks in the breast, and went back to the horsemen and said, \"The deed is done, I have made an end of both of them: but it went hard with me, in the struggle they rooted up trees to defend themselves, but it was of no use, they had to do with a man who can kill seven at one blow.\"", "\"Then are you not wounded?\" asked the horsemen.", "\"Nothing of the sort!\" answered the tailor, \"I have not turned a hair.\"", "The horsemen still would not believe it, and rode into the wood to see, and there they found the giants wallowing in their blood, and all about them lying the uprooted trees.", "The little tailor then claimed the promised boon, but the King repented him of his offer, and he sought again how to rid himself of the hero.", "\"Before you can possess my daughter and the half of my kingdom,\" said he to the tailor, \"you must perform another heroic act.", "In the wood lives a unicorn who does great damage; you must secure him.\"", "\"A unicorn does not strike more terror into me than two giants.", "Seven at one blow!\u2014that is my way,\" was the tailor's answer.", "So, taking a rope and an axe with him, he went out into the wood, and told those who were ordered to attend him to wait outside.", "He had not far to seek, the unicorn soon came out and sprang at him, as if he would make an end of him without delay.", "\"Softly, softly,\" said he, \"most haste, worst speed,\" and remained standing until the animal came quite near, then he slipped quietly behind a tree.", "The unicorn ran with all his might against the tree and stuck his horn so deep into the trunk that he could not get it out again, and so was taken.", "\"Now I have you,\" said the tailor, coming out from behind the tree, and, putting the rope round the unicorn's neck, he took the axe, set free the horn, and when all his party were assembled he led forth the animal and brought it to the King.", "The King did not yet wish to give him the promised reward, and set him a third task to do.", "Before the wedding could take place the tailor was to secure a wild boar which had done a great deal of damage in the wood.", "The huntsmen were to accompany him.", "\"All right,\" said the tailor, \"this is child's play.\"", "But he did not take the huntsmen into the wood, and they were all the better pleased, for the wild boar had many a time before received them in such a way that they had no fancy to disturb him.", "When the boar caught sight of the tailor he ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming tusks to bear him to the ground, but the nimble hero rushed into a chapel which chanced to be near, and jumped quickly out of a window on the other side.", "The boar ran after him, and when he got inside the door shut after him, and there he was imprisoned, for the creature was too big and unwieldy to jump out of the window too.", "Then the little tailor called the huntsmen that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes; and then he betook himself to the king, who now, whether he liked it or not, was obliged to fulfil his promise, and give him his daughter and the half of his kingdom.", "But if he had known that the great warrior was only a little tailor he would have taken it still more to heart.", "So the wedding was celebrated with great splendour and little joy, and the tailor was made into a king.", "One night the young queen heard her husband talking in his sleep and saying, \"Now boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders!\"", "And so, as she perceived of what low birth her husband was, she went to her father the next morning and told him all, and begged him to set her free from a man who was nothing better than a tailor.", "The king bade her be comforted, saying, \"To-night leave your bedroom door open, my guard shall stand outside, and when he is asleep they shall come in and bind him and carry him off to a ship, and he shall be sent to the other side of the world.\"", "So the wife felt consoled, but the king's water-bearer, who had been listening all the while, went to the little tailor and disclosed to him the whole plan \"I shall put a stop to all this,\" said he.", "At night he lay down as usual in bed, and when his wife thought that he was asleep, she got up, opened the door and lay down again.", "The little tailor, who only made believe to be asleep, began to murmur plainly, \"Now, boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders!", "I have slain seven at one blow, killed two giants, caught a unicorn, and taken a wild boar, and shall I be afraid of those who are standing outside my room door?\"", "And when they heard the tailor say this, a great fear seized them; they fled away as if they had been wild hares, and none of them would venture to attack him.", "And so the little tailor all his lifetime remained a king"], "bn_15417261n": ["THERE was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named Jack, and a cow named Milky-white.", "And all they had to live on was the milk the cow gave every morning, which they carried to the market and sold.", "But one morning Milky-white gave no milk, and they didn't know what to do.", "\"What shall we do, what shall we do?\" said the widow, wringing her hands.", "\"Cheer up, mother, I'll go and get work somewhere,\" said Jack.", "\"We've tried that before, and nobody would take you,\" said his mother; \"we must sell Milky-white and with the money start shop, or something.\"", "\"All right, mother,\" says Jack; \"it's market-day today, and I'll soon sell Milky-white, and then we'll see what we can do.\"", "So he took the cow's halter in his hand, and off he started.", "He hadn't gone far when he met a funny, looking old man, who said to him: \"Good morning, Jack.\"", "\"Good morning to you,\" said Jack, and wondered how he knew his name.", "\"Well, Jack, and where are you off to?\" said the man.", "\"I'm going to market to sell our cow here.\"", "\"Oh, you look the proper sort of chap to sell cows,\" said the man; \"I wonder if you know how many beans make five.\"", "\"Two in each hand and one in your mouth,\" says Jack, as sharp as a needle.", "\"Right you are,\" says the man, \"and here they are, the very beans themselves,\" he went on, pulling out of his pocket a number of strange-looking beans.", "\"As you are so sharp,\" says he, \"I don't mind doing a swop with you\u2014your cow for these beans.\"", "\"Go along,\" says Jack; \"wouldn't you like it?\"", "\"Ah! you don't know what these beans are,\" said the man; \"if you plant them over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky.\"", "\"Really?\" said Jack; \"you don't say so.\"", "\"Yes, that is so, and if it doesn't turn out to be true you can have your cow back.\"", "\"Right,\" says Jack, and hands him over Milky-white's halter and pockets the beans.", "Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn't gone very far it wasn't dusk by the time he got to his door.", "\"Back already, Jack?\" said his mother; \"I see you haven't got Milky-white, so you've sold her, How much did you get for her?\"", "\"You'll never guess, mother,\" says Jack.", "\"No, you don't say so.", "Good boy!", "Five pounds, ten, fifteen, no, it can't be twenty.\"", "\"I told you you couldn't guess.", "What do you say to these beans; they're magical, plant them overnight and\u2014\u2014\" \"What!\" says Jack's mother, \"have you been such a fool, such a dolt, such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans?", "Take that!", "Take that!", "Take that!", "And as for your precious beans here they go out of the window.", "And now off with you to bed.", "Not a sup shall you drink, and not a bit shall you swallow this very night.\"", "So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic, and sad and sorry he was, to be sure, as much for his mother's sake, as for the loss of his supper.", "At last he dropped off to sleep.", "When he woke up, the room looked so funny.", "The sun was shining into part of it, and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady.", "So Jack jumped up and dressed himself and went to the window.", "And what do you think he saw?", "Why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden, had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up till it reached the sky.", "So the man spoke truth after all.", "The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack's window, so all he had to do was to open it and give a jump on to the beanstalk which ran up just like a big ladder.", "So Jack climbed, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he reached the sky.", "And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart.", "So he walked along and he walked along and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman.", "\"Good morning, mum,\" says Jack, quite polite-like.", "\"Could you be so kind as to give me some breakfast?\"", "For he hadn't had anything to eat you know, the night before and was as hungry as a hunter \"It's breakfast you want, is it?\" says the great big tall woman, \"it's breakfast you'll be if you don't move off from here.", "My man is an ogre and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast.", "You'd better be moving on or he'll soon be coming.\"", "\"Oh! please mum, do give me something to eat, mum.", "I've had nothing to eat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum,\" says Jack, \"I may as well be broiled as die of hunger.\"", "Well, the ogre's wife was not half so bad after all.", "So she took Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk.", "But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump!", "thump!", "thump!", "the whole house began to tremble with the noise of some one coming.", "\"Goodness gracious me!", "It's my old man,\" said the ogre's wife, \"what on earth shall I do?", "Come along quick and jump in here.\"", "And she bundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in.", "He was a big one, to be sure.", "At his belt he had three calves strung up by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and said: \"Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast.", "Ah!", "What's this I smell?", "Fee-fi-fo-fum,", "I smell the blood of an Englishman,", "Be he alive, or be he dead", "I'll have his bones to grind my bread.\"", "\"Nonsense, dear,\" said his wife, \"you're dreaming.", "Or perhaps you smell the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday's dinner.", "Here, you go and have a wash and tidy up, and by the time you come back your breakfast'll be ready for you.\"", "So off the ogre went, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven and run away when the woman told him not.", "\"Wait till he's asleep,\" says she; \"he always has a doze after breakfast.\"", "Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold, and down he sits and counts till at last his head began to nod", "and he began to snore till the whole house shook again.", "Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold, which of course fell into his mother's garden, and then he climbed down and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed her the gold and said: \"Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans?", "They are really magical, you see.\"", "So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came to the end of it, and Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more up at the top of the beanstalk.", "So one fine morning he rose up early, and got on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he came out on to the road again and up to the great big tall house he had been to before.", "There, sure enough, was the great big tall woman a-standing on the doorstep.", "\"Good morning, mum,\" says Jack, as bold as brass, \"could you be so good as to give me something to eat?\"", "\"Go away, my boy,\" said the big tall woman, \"or else my man will eat you up for breakfast.", "But aren't you the youngster who came here once before?", "Do you know, that very day, my man missed one of his bags of gold.\"", "\"That's strange, mum,\" said Jack, \"I dare say I could tell you something about that, but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to eat.\"", "Well the big tall woman was so curious that she took him in and gave him something to eat.", "But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as he could when thump!", "thump!", "thump!", "they heard the giant's footstep, and his wife hid Jack away in the oven.", "All happened as it did before.", "In came the ogre as he did before, said: \"Fee-fi-fo-fum,\" and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen.", "Then he said: \"Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs.\"", "So she brought it, and the ogre said: \"Lay,\" and it laid an egg all of gold.", "And then the ogre began to nod his head, and to snore till the house shook.", "Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden hen, and was off before you could say \"Jack Robinson.\"", "But this time the hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got out of the house he heard him calling: \"Wife, wife, what have you done with my golden hen?\"", "And the wife said: \"Why, my dear?\"", "But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and climbed down like a house on fire.", "And when he got home he showed his mother the wonderful hen, and said \"Lay\" to it; and it laid a golden egg every time he said \"Lay.\"", "Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't very long before he determined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk.", "So one fine morning, he rose up early, and got on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till he got to the top.", "But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's house.", "And when he got near it, he waited behind a bush till he saw the ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept into the house and got into the copper.", "He hadn't been there long when he heard thump!", "thump!", "thump!", "as before, and in come the ogre and his wife.", "\"Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman,\" cried out the ogre.", "\"I smell him, wife, I smell him.\"", "\"Do you, my dearie?\" says the ogre's wife.", "Then, if it's that little rogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he's sure to have got into the oven.\"", "And they both rushed to the oven.", "But Jack wasn't there, luckily, and the ogre's wife said: \"There you are again with your fee-fi-fo-fum.", "Why of course it's the boy you caught last night that I've just broiled for your breakfast.", "How forgetful I am, and how careless you are not to know the difference between live and dead after all these years.\"", "So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and then he would mutter: \"Well, I could have sworn\u2014\u2014\" and he'd get up and search the larder and the cupboards and everything, only, luckily, he didn't think of the copper.", "After breakfast was over, the ogre called out \"Wife, wife, bring me my golden harp.\"", "So she brought it and put it on the table before him.", "Then he said: \"Sing!\" and the golden harp sang most beautifully.", "And it went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.", "Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door.", "But the harp called out quite loud: \"Master! Master!\"", "and the ogre woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp.", "Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew where he was going.", "When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack disappear like, and when he came to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath climbing down for dear life.", "Well, the ogre didn't like trusting himself to such a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another start.", "But just then the harp cried out: \"Master!", "Master!\"", "and the ogre swung himself down on to the beanstalk, which shook with his weight.", "Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre.", "By this time Jack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home.", "So he called out: \"Mother!", "Mother! bring me an axe, bring me an axe.\"", "And his mother came rushing out with the axe in her hand, but when she came to the beanstalk she stood stock still with fright for there she saw the ogre with his legs just through the clouds.", "But Jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the beanstalk which cut it half in two.", "The ogre felt the beanstalk shake and quiver so he stopped to see what was the matter.", "Then Jack gave another chop with the axe, and the beanstalk was cut in two and began to topple over.", "Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the beanstalk came toppling after.", "Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that and selling the golden eggs Jack and his mother became very rich, and he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever after"], "bn_03655527n": ["Pa had sent me out to get an extra pail of air.", "I'd just about scooped it full and most of the warmth had leaked from my fingers when I saw the thing.", "You know, at first I thought it was a young lady.", "Yes, a beautiful young lady's face all glowing in the dark and looking at me from the fifth floor of the opposite apartment, which hereabouts is the floor just above the white blanket of frozen air.", "I'd never seen a live young lady before, except in the old magazines--Sis is just a kid and Ma is pretty sick and miserable--and it gave me such a start that I dropped the pail.", "Who wouldn't, knowing everyone on Earth was dead except Pa and Ma and Sis and you?", "Even at that, I don't suppose I should have been surprised.", "We all see things now and then.", "Ma has some pretty bad ones, to judge from the way she bugs her eyes at nothing and just screams and screams and huddles back against the blankets hanging around the Nest.", "Pa says it is natural we should react like that sometimes.", "When I'd recovered the pail and could look again at the opposite apartment, I got an idea of what Ma might be feeling at those times, for I saw it wasn't a young lady at all but simply a light--a tiny light that moved stealthily from window to window, just as if one of the cruel little stars had come down out of the airless sky to investigate why the Earth had gone away from the Sun, and maybe to hunt down something to torment or terrify, now that the Earth didn't have the Sun's protection.", "I tell you, the thought of it gave me the creeps.", "I just stood there shaking, and almost froze my feet and did frost my helmet so solid on the inside that I couldn't have seen the light even if it had come out of one of the windows to get me.", "Then I had the wit to go back inside.", "Pretty soon I was feeling my familiar way through the thirty or so blankets and rugs Pa has got hung around to slow down the escape of air from the Nest, and I wasn't quite so scared.", "I began to hear the tick-ticking of the clocks in the Nest and knew I was getting back into air, because there's no sound outside in the vacuum, of course.", "But my mind was still crawly and uneasy as I pushed through the last blankets--Pa's got them faced with aluminum foil to hold in the heat--and came into the Nest.", "Let me tell you about the Nest.", "It's low and snug, just room for the four of us and our things.", "The floor is covered with thick woolly rugs.", "Three of the sides are blankets, and the blankets roofing it touch Pa's head.", "He tells me it's inside a much bigger room, but I've never

early days there was only Ma to take turns with Pa--I think of that when she gets difficult--but now there's me to help, and Sis too.", "It's Pa who is the chief guardian of the fire, though.", "I always think of him that way: a tall man sitting cross-legged, frowning anxiously at the fire, his lined face golden in its light, and every so often carefully placing on it a piece of coal from the big heap beside it.", "Pa tells me there used to be guardians of the fire sometimes in the very old days--vestal virgins, he calls them--although there was unfrozen air all around then and you didn't really need one.", "He was sitting just that way now, though he got up quick to take the pail from me and bawl me out for loitering--he'd spotted my frozen helmet right off.", "That roused Ma and she joined in picking on me.", "She's always trying to get the load off her feelings, Pa explains.", "He shut her up pretty fast.", "Sis let off a couple of silly squeals too.", "Pa handled the pail of air in a twist of cloth.", "Now that it was inside the Nest, you could really feel its coldness.", "It just seemed to suck the heat out of everything.", "Even the flames cringed away from it as Pa put it down close by the fire.", "Yet it's that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive.", "It slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the fire.", "The blankets keep it from escaping too fast.", "Pa'd like to seal the whole place, but he can't--building's too earthquake-twisted, and besides he has to leave the chimney open for smoke.", "Pa says air is tiny molecules that fly away like a flash if there isn't something to stop them.", "We have to watch sharp not to let the air run low.", "Pa always keeps a big reserve supply of it in buckets behind the first blankets, along with extra coal and cans of food and other things, such as pails of snow to melt for water.", "We have to go way down to the bottom floor for that stuff, which is a mean trip, and get it through a door to outside.", "You see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe.", "Of course, all the parts of the air didn't freeze and snow down at the same time.", "First to drop out was the carbon dioxide--when you're shoveling for water, you have to make sure you don't go too high and get any of that stuff mixed in, for it would put you to sleep, maybe for good, and make the fire go out.", "Next there's the nitrogen, which doesn't count one way or the other, though it's the biggest part of the blanket.", "On top of that and easy to get at, which is lucky for us, there's the oxygen that keeps us alive.", "Pa says we live better than kings ever did, breathing pure oxygen, but we're used to it and don't notice.", "Finally, at the very top, there's a slick of liquid helium, which is funny stuff.", "All of these gases in neat separate layers.", "Like a pussy caffay, Pa laughingly says, whatever that is.", "I was busting to tell them all about what I'd seen, and so as soon as I'd ducked out of my helmet and while I was still climbing out of my suit, I cut loose.", "Right away Ma got nervous and began making eyes at the entry-slit in the blankets and wringing her hands together--the hand where she'd lost three fingers from frostbite inside the good one, as usual.", "I could tell that Pa was annoyed at me scaring her and wanted to explain it all away quickly, yet could see I wasn't fooling.", "\"And you watched this light for some time, son?\"", "he asked when I finished.", "I hadn't said anything about first thinking it was a young lady's face.", "Somehow that part embarrassed me.", "\"Long enough for it to pass five windows and go to the next floor.\"", "\"And it didn't look like stray electricity or crawling liquid or starlight focused by a growing crystal, or anything like that?\"", "He wasn't just making up those ideas.", "Odd things happen in a world that's about as cold as can be, and just when you think matter would be frozen dead, it takes on a strange new life.", "A slimy stuff comes crawling toward the Nest, just like an animal snuffing for heat--that's the liquid helium.", "And once, when I was little, a bolt of lightning--not even Pa could figure where it came from--hit the nearby steeple and crawled up and down it for weeks, until the glow finally died.", "\"Not like anything I ever saw,\" I told him.", "He stood for a moment frowning.", "Then, \"I'll go out with you, and you show it to me,\" he said.", "Ma raised a howl at the idea of being left alone, and Sis joined in, too, but Pa quieted them.", "We started climbing into our outside clothes--mine had been warming by the fire.", "Pa made them.", "They have plastic headpieces that were once big double-duty transparent food cans, but they keep heat and air in and can replace the air for a little while, long enough for our trips for water and coal and food and so on.", "Ma started moaning again, \"I've always known there was something outside there, waiting to get us.", "I've felt it for years--something that's part of the cold and hates all warmth and wants to destroy the Nest.", "It's been watching us all this time, and now it's coming after us.", "It'll get you and then come for me.", "Don't go, Harry!\"", "Pa had everything on but his helmet.", "He knelt by the fireplace and reached in and shook the long metal rod that goes up the chimney and knocks off the ice that keeps trying to clog it.", "Once a week he goes up on the roof to check if it's working all right.", "That's our worst trip and Pa won't let me make it alone.", "\"Sis,\" Pa said quietly, \"come watch the fire.", "Keep an eye on the air, too.", "If it gets low or doesn't seem to be boiling fast enough, fetch another bucket from behind the blanket.", "But mind your hands.", "Use the cloth to pick up the bucket.\"", "Sis quit helping Ma be frightened and came over and did as she was told.", "Ma quieted down pretty suddenly, though her eyes were still kind of wild as she watched Pa fix on his helmet tight and pick up a pail and the two of us go out.", "Pa led the way and I took hold of his belt.", "It's a funny thing, I'm not afraid to go by myself, but when Pa's along I always want to hold on to him.", "Habit, I guess, and then there's no denying that this time I was a bit scared.", "You see, it's this way.", "We know that everything is dead out there.", "Pa heard the last radio voices fade away years ago, and had seen some of the last folks die who weren't as lucky or well-protected as us.", "So we knew that if there was something groping around out there, it couldn't be anything human or friendly.", "Besides that, there's a feeling that comes with it always being night, _cold_ night.", "Pa says there used to be some of that feeling even in the old days, but then every morning the Sun would come and chase it away.", "I have to take his word for that, not ever remembering the Sun as being anything more than a big star.", "You see, I hadn't been born when the dark star snatched us away from the Sun, and by now it's dragged us out beyond the orbit of the planet Pluto, Pa says, and taking us farther out all the time.", "I found myself wondering whether there mightn't be something on the dark star that wanted us, and if that was why it had captured the Earth.", "Just then we came to the end of the corridor and I followed Pa out on the balcony.", "I don't know what the city looked like in the old days, but now it's beautiful.", "The starlight lets you see it pretty well--there's quite a bit of light in those steady points speckling the blackness above.", "(Pa says the stars used to twinkle once, but that was because there was air.)", "We are on a hill and the shimmery plain drops away from us and then flattens out, cut up into neat squares by the troughs that used to be streets.", "I sometimes make my mashed potatoes look like it, before I pour on the gravy.", "Some taller buildings push up out of the feathery plain, topped by rounded caps of air crystals, like the fur hood Ma wears, only whiter.", "On those buildings you can see the darker squares of windows, underlined by white dashes of air crystals.", "Some of them are on a slant, for many of the buildings are pretty badly twisted by the quakes and all the rest that happened when the dark star captured the Earth.", "Here and there a few icicles hang, water icicles from the first days of the cold, other icicles of frozen air that melted on the roofs and dripped and froze again.", "Sometimes one of those icicles will catch the light of a star and send it to you so brightly you think the star has swooped into the city.", "That was one of the things Pa had been thinking of when I told him about the light, but I had thought of it myself first and known it wasn't so.", "He touched his helmet to mine so we could talk easier and he asked me to point out the windows to him.", "But there wasn't any light moving around inside them now, or anywhere else.", "To my surprise, Pa didn't bawl me out and tell me I'd been seeing things.", "He looked all around quite a while after filling his pail, and just as we were going inside he whipped around without warning, as if to take some peeping thing off guard.", "I could feel it, too.", "The old peace was gone.", "There was something lurking out there, watching, waiting, getting ready.", "Inside, he said to me, touching helmets, \"If you see something like that again, son, don't tell the others.", "Your Ma's sort of nervous these days", "and we owe her all the feeling of safety we can give her.", "Once--it was when your sister was born--I was ready to give up and die, but your Mother kept me trying.", "Another time she kept the fire going a whole week all by herself when I was sick.", "Nursed me and took care of the two of you, too.\"", "\"You know that game we sometimes play, sitting in a square in the Nest, tossing a ball around?", "Courage is like a ball, son.", "A person can hold it only so long, and then he's got to toss it to someone else.", "When it's tossed your way, you've got to catch it and hold it tight--and hope there'll be someone else to toss it to when you get tired of being brave.\"", "His talking to me that way made me feel grown-up and good.", "But it didn't wipe away the thing outside from the back of my mind--or the fact that Pa took it seriously.", "It's hard to hide your feelings about such a thing.", "When we got back in the Nest and took off our outside clothes, Pa laughed about it all and told them it was nothing and kidded me for having such an imagination, but his words fell flat.", "He didn't convince Ma and Sis any more than he did me.", "It looked for a minute like we were all fumbling the courage-ball.", "Something had to be done, and almost before I knew what I was going to say, I heard myself asking Pa to tell us about the old days, and how it all happened.", "He sometimes doesn't mind telling that story, and Sis and I sure like to listen to it, and he got my idea.", "So we were all settled around the fire in a wink, and Ma pushed up some cans to thaw for supper, and Pa began.", "Before he did, though, I noticed him casually get a hammer from the shelf and lay it down beside him.", "It was the same old story as always--I think I could recite the main thread of it in my sleep--though Pa always puts in a new detail or two and keeps improving it in spots.", "He told us how the Earth had been swinging around the Sun ever so steady and warm, and the people on it fixing to make money and wars and have a good time and get power and treat each other right or wrong, when without warning there comes charging out of space this dead star, this burned out sun, and upsets everything.", "You know, I find it hard to believe in the way those people felt, any more than I can believe in the swarming number of them.", "Imagine people getting ready for the horrible sort of war they were cooking up.", "Wanting it even, or at least wishing it were over so as to end their nervousness.", "As if all folks didn't have to hang together and pool every bit of warmth just to keep alive.", "And how can they have hoped to end danger, any more than we can hope to end the cold?", "Sometimes I think Pa exaggerates and makes things out too black.", "He's cross with us once in a while and was probably cross with all those folks.", "Still, some of the things I read in the old magazines sound pretty wild.", "He may be right.", "The dark star, as Pa went on telling it, rushed in pretty fast and there wasn't much time to get ready.", "At the beginning they tried to keep it a secret from most people, but then the truth came out, what with the earthquakes and floods--imagine, oceans of _unfrozen_", "water!--and people seeing stars blotted out by something on a clear night.", "First off they thought it would hit the Sun, and then they thought it would hit the Earth.", "There was even the start of a rush to get to a place called China, because people thought the star would hit on the other side.", "But then they found it wasn't going to hit either side, but was going to come very close to the Earth.", "Most of the other planets were on the other side of the Sun and didn't get involved.", "The Sun and the newcomer fought over the Earth for a little while--pulling it this way and that, like two dogs growling over a bone, Pa described it this time--and then the newcomer won and carried us off.", "The Sun got a consolation prize, though.", "At the last minute he managed to hold on to the Moon.", "That was the time of the monster earthquakes and floods, twenty times worse than anything before.", "It was also the time of the Big Jerk, as Pa calls it, when all Earth got yanked suddenly, just as Pa has done to me once or twice, grabbing me by the collar to do it, when I've been sitting too far from the fire.", "You see, the dark star was going through space faster than the Sun, and in the opposite direction, and it had to wrench the world considerably in order to take it away.", "The Big Jerk didn't last long.", "It was over as soon as the Earth was settled down in its new orbit around the dark star.", "But it was pretty terrible while it lasted.", "Pa says that all sorts of cliffs and buildings toppled, oceans slopped over, swamps and sandy deserts gave great sliding surges that buried nearby lands.", "Earth was almost jerked out of its atmosphere blanket and the air got so thin in spots that people keeled over and fainted--though of course, at the same time, they were getting knocked down by the Big Jerk and maybe their bones broke or skulls cracked.", "We've often asked Pa how people acted during that time, whether they were scared or brave or crazy or stunned, or all four, but he's sort of leery of the subject, and he was again tonight.", "He says he was mostly too busy to notice.", "You see, Pa and some scientist friends of his had figured out part of what was going to happen--they'd known we'd get captured and our air would freeze--and they'd been working like mad to fix up a place with airtight walls and doors, and insulation against the cold, and big supplies of food and fuel and water and bottled air.", "But the place got smashed in the last earthquakes and all Pa's friends were killed then and in the Big Jerk.", "So he had to start over and throw the Nest together quick without any advantages, just using any stuff he could lay his hands on.", "I guess he's telling pretty much the truth when he says he didn't have any time to keep an eye on how other folks behaved, either then or in the Big Freeze that followed--followed very quick, you know, both because the dark star was pulling us away very fast and because Earth's rotation had been slowed in the tug-of-war, so that the nights were ten old nights long.", "Still, I've got an idea of some of the things that happened from the frozen folk I've seen, a few of them in other rooms in our building, others clustered around the furnaces in the basements where we go for coal.", "In one of the rooms, an old man sits stiff in a chair, with an arm and a leg in splints.", "In another, a man and woman are huddled together in a bed with heaps of covers over them.", "You can just see their heads peeking out, close together.", "And in another a beautiful young lady is sitting with a pile of wraps huddled around her, looking hopefully toward the door, as if waiting for someone who never came back with warmth and food.", "They're all still and stiff as statues, of course, but just like life.", "Pa showed them to me once in quick winks of his flashlight, when he still had a fair supply of batteries and could afford to waste a little light.", "They scared me pretty bad and made my heart pound, especially the young lady.", "Now, with Pa telling his story for the umpteenth time to take our minds off another scare, I got to thinking of the frozen folk again.", "All of a sudden I got an idea that scared me worse than anything yet.", "You see, I'd just remembered the face I'd thought I'd seen in the window.", "I'd forgotten about that on account of trying to hide it from the others.", "What, I asked myself, if the frozen folk were coming to life?", "What if they were like the liquid helium that got a new lease on life and started crawling toward the heat just when you thought its molecules ought to freeze solid forever?", "Or like the electricity that moves endlessly when it's just about as cold as that?", "What if the ever-growing cold, with the temperature creeping down the last few degrees to the last zero, had mysteriously wakened the frozen folk to life--not warm-blooded life, but something icy and horrible?", "That was a worse idea than the one about something coming down from the dark star to get us.", "Or maybe, I thought, both ideas might be true.", "Something coming down from the dark star and making the frozen folk move, using them to do its work.", "That would fit with both things I'd seen--the beautiful young lady and the moving, starlike light.", "The frozen folk with minds from the dark star behind their unwinking eyes, creeping, crawling, snuffing their way, following the heat to the Nest.", "I tell you, that thought gave me a very bad turn and I wanted very badly to tell the others my fears, but I remembered what Pa had said and clenched my teeth and didn't speak.", "We were all sitting very still.", "Even the fire was burning silently.", "There was just the sound of Pa's voice and the clocks.", "And then, from beyond the blankets, I thought I heard a tiny noise.", "My skin tightened all over me.", "Pa was telling about the early years in the Nest and had come to the place where he philosophizes.", "\"So I asked myself then,\" he said, \"what's the use of going on?", "What's the use of dragging it out for a few years?", "Why prolong a doomed existence of hard work and cold and loneliness?", "The human race is done.", "The Earth is done.", "Why not give up, I asked myself--and all of a sudden I got the answer.\"", "Again I heard the noise, louder this time, a kind of uncertain, shuffling tread, coming closer.", "I couldn't breathe.", "\"Life's always been a business of working hard and fighting the cold,\" Pa was saying.", "\"The earth's always been a lonely place, millions of miles from the next planet.", "And no matter how long the human race might have lived, the end would have come some night.", "Those things don't matter.", "What matters is that life is good.", "It has a lovely texture, like some rich cloth or fur, or the petals of flowers--you've seen pictures of those, but I can't describe how they feel--or the fire's glow.", "It makes everything else worth while.", "And that's as true for the last man as the first.\"", "And still the steps kept shuffling closer.", "It seemed to me that the inmost blanket trembled and bulged a little.", "Just as if they were burned into my imagination, I kept seeing those peering, frozen eyes.", "\"So right then and there,\" Pa went on, and now I could tell that he heard the steps, too, and was talking loud so we maybe wouldn't hear them, \"right then and there I told myself that I was going on as if we had all eternity ahead of us.", "I'd have children and teach them all I could.", "I'd get them to read books.", "I'd plan for the future, try to enlarge and seal the Nest.", "I'd do what I could to keep everything beautiful and growing.", "I'd keep alive my feeling of wonder even at the cold and the dark and the distant stars.\"", "But then the blanket actually did move and lift.", "And there was a bright light somewhere behind it.", "Pa's voice stopped and his eyes turned to the widening slit and his hand went out until it touched and gripped the handle of the hammer beside him.", "In through the blanket stepped the beautiful young lady.", "She stood there looking at us the strangest way, and she carried something bright and unwinking in her hand.", "And two other faces peered over her shoulders--men's faces, white and staring.", "Well, my heart couldn't have been stopped for more than four or five beats before I realized she was wearing a suit and helmet like Pa's homemade ones, only fancier, and that the men were, too--and that the frozen folk certainly wouldn't be wearing those.", "Also, I noticed that the bright thing in her hand was just a kind of flashlight.", "The silence kept on while I swallowed hard a couple of times, and after that there was all sorts of jabbering and commotion.", "They were simply people, you see.", "We hadn't been the only ones to survive; we'd just thought so, for natural enough reasons.", "These three people had survived, and quite a few others with them.", "And when we found out _how_ they'd survived, Pa let out the biggest whoop of joy.", "They were from Los Alamos and they were getting their heat and power from atomic energy.", "Just using the uranium and plutonium intended for bombs, they had enough to go on for thousands of years.", "They had a regular little airtight city, with air-locks and all.", "They even generated electric light and grew plants and animals by it.", "(At this Pa let out a second whoop, waking Ma from her faint.)", "But if we were flabbergasted at them, they were double-flabbergasted at us.", "One of the men kept saying, \"But it's impossible, I tell you.", "You can't maintain an air supply without hermetic sealing.", "It's simply impossible.\"", "That was after he had got his helmet off and was using our air.", "Meanwhile, the young lady kept looking around at us as if we were saints, and telling us we'd done something amazing, and suddenly she broke down and cried.", "They'd been scouting around for survivors, but they never expected to find any in a place like this.", "They had rocket ships at Los Alamos and plenty of chemical fuel.", "As for liquid oxygen, all you had to do was go out and shovel the air blanket at the top _level_.", "So after they'd got things going smoothly at Los Alamos, which had taken years, they'd decided to make some trips to likely places where there might be other survivors.", "No good trying long-distance radio signals, of course, since there was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth.", "Well, they'd found other colonies at Argonne and Brookhaven and way around the world at Harwell and Tanna Tuva.", "And now they'd been giving our city a look, not really expecting to find anything.", "But they had an instrument that noticed the faintest heat waves and it had told them there was something warm down here, so they'd landed to investigate.", "Of course we hadn't heard them land, since there was no air to carry the sound, and they'd had to investigate around quite a while before finding us.", "Their instruments had given them a wrong steer and they'd wasted some time in the building across the street.", "By now, all five adults were talking like sixty.", "Pa was demonstrating to the men how he worked the fire and got rid of the ice in the chimney and all that.", "Ma had perked up wonderfully and was showing the young lady her cooking and sewing stuff, and even asking about how the women dressed at Los Alamos.", "The strangers marveled at everything and praised it to the skies.", "I could tell from the way they wrinkled their noses that they found the Nest a bit smelly, but they never mentioned that at all and just asked bushels of questions.", "In fact, there was so much talking and excitement that Pa forgot about things, and it wasn't until they were all getting groggy that he looked and found the air had all boiled away in the pail.", "He got another bucket of air quick from behind the blankets.", "Of course that started them all laughing and jabbering again.", "The newcomers even got a little drunk.", "They weren't used to so much oxygen.", "Funny thing, though--I didn't do much talking at all and Sis hung on to Ma all the time and hid her face when anybody looked at her.", "I felt pretty uncomfortable and disturbed myself, even about the young lady.", "Glimpsing her outside there, I'd had all sorts of mushy thoughts, but now I was just embarrassed and scared of her, even though she tried to be nice as anything to me.", "I sort of wished they'd all quit crowding the Nest and let us be alone and get our feelings straightened out.", "And when the newcomers began to talk about our all going to Los Alamos, as if that were taken for granted, I could see that something of the same feeling struck Pa and Ma, too.", "Pa got very silent all of a sudden and Ma kept telling the young lady, \"But I wouldn't know how to act there and I haven't any clothes.\"", "The strangers were puzzled like anything at first, but then they got the idea.", "As Pa kept saying, \"It just doesn't seem right to let this fire go out.\"", "Well, the strangers are gone, but they're coming back.", "It hasn't been decided yet just what will happen.", "Maybe the Nest will be kept up as what one of the strangers called a \"survival school.\"", "Or maybe we will join the pioneers who are going to try to establish a new colony at the uranium mines at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo.", "Of course, now that the strangers are gone, I've been thinking a lot about Los Alamos and those other tremendous colonies.", "I have a hankering to see them for myself.", "You ask me, Pa wants to see them, too.", "He's been getting pretty thoughtful, watching Ma and Sis perk up.", "\"It's different, now that we know others are alive,\" he explains to me.", "\"Your mother doesn't feel so hopeless any more.", "Neither do I, for that matter, not having to carry the whole responsibility for keeping the human race going, so to speak.", "It scares a person.\"  I looked around at the blanket walls and the fire and the pails of air boiling away and Ma and Sis sleeping in the warmth and the flickering light.", "\"It's not going to be easy to leave the Nest,\" I said, wanting to cry, kind of.", "\"It's so small and there's just the four of us.", "I get scared at the idea of big places and a lot of strangers.\"", "He nodded and put another piece of coal on the fire.", "Then he looked at the little pile and grinned suddenly and put a couple of handfuls on, just as if it was one of our birthdays or Christmas.", "\"You'll quickly get over that feeling son,\" he said.", "\"The trouble with the world was that it kept getting smaller and smaller, till it ended with just the Nest.", "Now it'll be good to have a real huge world again, the way it was in the beginning.\"", "I guess he's right.", "You think the beautiful young lady will wait for me till I grow up?", "I'll be twenty in only ten years"], "bn_03813035n": ["A POOR widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red.", "She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red.", "Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do.", "The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand-in-hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said: \u2018We will never desert each other,\u2019 Rose-red answered: \u2018No, not as long as we live;\u2019 and the mother added: \u2018Whatever one gets she shall share with the other.\u2019", "They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them in the most confiding manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf-from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.", "No evil ever befell them; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious about them.", "Once, when they had slept the night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun, they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place.", "The figure got up, looked at them kindly but said nothing, and vanished into the wood.", "And when they looked round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a precipice, over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness.", "And when they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children.", "Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\u2019s cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it.", "In summer Rose-red looked after the house, and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each tree a rose.", "In winter Snow-white lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold.", "In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said: \u2018Snow-white, go and close the shutters;\u2019 and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book, and the two girls listened and sat and span.", "Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.", "One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance.", "The mother said: \u2018Rose-red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveller seeking shelter.\u2019", "Rose-red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the door.", "Rose-red screamed aloud", "and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother\u2019s bed.", "But the bear began to speak, and said: \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid: I won\u2019t hurt you.", "I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.\u2019", "\u2018My poor bear,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018lie down by the fire, only take care you don\u2019t burn your fur.\u2019", "Then she called out: \u2018Snow-white and Rose-red, come out; the bear will do you no harm: he is a good, honest creature.\u2019", "So they both came out of their hiding-places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot their fear.", "The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry.", "Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably.", "The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life.", "They tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he growled they only laughed.", "The bear submitted to everything with the best possible good-nature, only when they went too far he cried \u2018Oh! children, spare my life!", "Snow-white and Rose-red,", "Don\u2019t beat your lover dead.\u2019", "When it was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: \u2018You can lie there on the hearth, in heaven\u2019s name; it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet.\u2019", "As soon as day dawned the children let him out, and he trotted over the snow into the wood.", "From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance.", "When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: \u2018Now I must go away, and not return again the whole summer.\u2019", "\u2018Where are going to, dear bear?\u2019 asked Snow-white.", "\u2018I must go to the wood

has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy the land and steal what they can: what once falls into their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light.\u2019", "Snow-white was quite sad over their friend\u2019s departure, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear, stepping out, caught a piece of his fur in the door- knocker, and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it, but she couldn\u2019t be certain of it; and the bear ran hastily behind the trees.", "A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots.", "They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn\u2019t distinguish.", "When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long.", "The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain, and didn\u2019t seem to know what he was to do.", "He glared at the girls with his fiery eyes, and screamed out: \u2018What are you standing there for?", "can\u2019t you come and help me?\u2019", "\u2018What were you doing, little man?\u2019 asked Rose-red.", "\u2018You stupid, inquisitive goose!\u2019 replied the dwarf; \u2018I wanted to split the tree, in order to get little chips of wood for our kitchen fire; those thick logs that serve to make fires for coarse, greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food we need.", "I had successfully driven in the wedge, and all was going well, but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed up so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white beard out, so here I am stuck fast, and I can\u2019t get away; and you silly, smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh!", "Ugh!", "what wretches you are!\u2019", "The children did all in their power, but they couldn\u2019t get the beard out; it was wedged in far too firmly.", "\u2018I will run and fetch somebody,\u2019 said Rose-red.", "\u2018Crazy blockheads!\u2019 snapped the dwarf; \u2018what\u2019s the good of calling anyone else?", "you\u2019re already two too many for me.", "Does nothing better occur to you than that?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t be so impatient,\u2019 said Snow-white, \u2018I\u2019ll see you get help;\u2019 and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut the end off his beard.", "As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: \u2018Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!\u2019", "With these words he swung the bag over his back, and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.", "Shortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish.", "As they approached the stream they saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper, springing towards the water as if it were going to jump in.", "They ran forward and recognised their old friend the dwarf.", "\u2018Where are you going to?\u2019 asked Rose-red; \u2018you\u2019re surely not going to jump into the water?\u2019", "\u2018I\u2019m not such a fool,\u2019 screamed the dwarf.", "\u2018Don\u2019t you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?\u2019", "The little man had been sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line; and when immediately afterwards a big fish bit, the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper fin, and dragged the dwarf towards him.", "He clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of grass, but it didn\u2019t help him much; he had to follow every movement of the fish, and was in great danger of being drawn into the water.", "The girls came up just at the right moment, held him firm, and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in a hopeless muddle.", "Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard, by which a small part of it was sacrificed.", "When the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: \u2018Do you call that manners, you toadstools!", "to disfigure a fellow\u2019s face?", "It wasn\u2019t enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must now needs cut off the best bit of it.", "I can\u2019t appear like this before my own people.",

happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons.", "Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there.", "While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them.", "Immediately afterwards they heard a sharp, piercing cry.", "They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off.", "The tender-hearted children seized a hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey.", "When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice: \u2018Couldn\u2019t you have treated me more carefully?", "you have torn my thin little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!\u2019", "Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave.", "The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town.", "On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour.", "The evening sun shone on the glittering stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them.", "\u2018What are you standing there gaping for?\u2019 screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became scarlet with rage.", "He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood.", "The dwarf jumped up in a great fright, but he hadn\u2019t time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already close to him.", "Then he cried in terror: \u2018Dear Mr. Bear, spare me!", "I\u2019ll give you all my treasure.", "Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there.", "Spare my life!", "what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me?", "You won\u2019t feel me between your teeth.", "There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u2019", "But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.", "The girls had run away, but the bear called after them: \u2018Snow white and Rose-red, don\u2019t be afraid; wait, and I\u2019ll come with you.\u2019", "Then they recognised his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all dressed in gold.", "\u2018I am a king\u2019s son,\u2019 he said, \u2018and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should

is so still, that whilst a good word gains love and profit, slander brings enmity and ruin; and when you shall have heard how this happens, you will say I speak with reason.", "Once upon a time there were two brothers,\u2014Cianne, who was as rich as a lord, and Lise, who had barely enough to live upon: but poor as one was in fortune, so pitiful was the other in mind, for he would not have given his brother a farthing were it to save his life; so that poor Lise in despair left his country, and set out to wander over the world.", "And he wandered on and on, till one wet and cold evening he came to an inn, where he found twelve youths seated around a fire, who when they saw poor Lise benumbed with cold, partly from the severe season and partly from his ragged clothes, invited him to sit down by the fire.", "Lise accepted the invitation, for he needed it greatly, and began to warm himself.", "And as he was warming himself, one of the young men, whose face was such a picture of moroseness as to make you die of affright, said to him, \u201cWhat think you, countryman, of this weather?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do I think of it?\u201d replied Lise; \u201cI think that all the months of the year perform their duty; but we, who know not what we would have, wish to give laws to Heaven; and wanting to have things our own way, we do not fish deeply enough to the bottom, to find out whether what comes into our fancy be good or evil, useful or hurtful.", "In winter, when it rains, we want the sun in Leo, and in the month of August the clouds to discharge themselves; not reflecting, that were this the case, the seasons would be turned topsy-turvy, the seed sown would be lost, the crops would be destroyed, the bodies of men would faint away, and Nature would go head over heels.", "Therefore let us leave Heaven to its own course; for it has made the tree to mitigate with its wood the severity of winter, and with its leaves the heat of summer.\u201d", "\u201cYou speak like Samson!\u201d said the youth; \u201cbut you cannot deny that this month of March, in which we now are, is very impertinent to send all this frost and rain, snow and hail, wind and storm, these fogs and tempests and other troubles, that make one's life a burden.\u201d", "\u201cYou tell only the ill of this poor month,\u201d replied Lise, \u201cbut do not speak of the benefits it yields us; for, by bringing forward the Spring, it commences the production of things, and is alone the cause that the Sun proves the happiness of the present time, by leading him into the house of the Ram.\u201d", "The youth was greatly pleased at what Lise said, for he was in truth no other than the month of March itself, who had arrived at that inn with his eleven brothers; and to reward Lise's goodness, who had not even found anything ill to say of a month so sad that the shepherds do not like to mention it, he gave him a beautiful little casket, saying, \u201cTake this, and if you want anything, only ask for it, and opening this box you will see it before you.\u201d", "Lise thanked the youth, with many expressions of respect, and laying the little box under his head by way of a pillow, he went to sleep.", "As soon however as the Sun, with the pencil of his rays, had retouched the dark shadows of Night, Lise took leave of the youths and set out on his way.", "But he had hardly proceeded fifty steps from the inn, when, opening the casket, he said, \u201cAh, my friend, I wish I had a litter lined with cloth, and with a little fire inside, that I might travel warm and comfortable through the snow!\u201d", "No sooner had he uttered the words, than there appeared a litter, with bearers, who lifting him up placed him in it; whereupon he told them to carry him home.", "When the hour was come to set the jaws to work, Lise opened the little box and said, \u201cI wish for something to eat.\u201d", "And instantly there appeared a profusion of the choicest food, and there was such a banquet that ten crowned kings might have feasted on it.", "One evening having come to a wood, which did not give admittance to the Sun because he came from suspected placesAlluding to the quarantine which ships were subject to coming from the East.\u2014L., Lise opened the little casket, and said, \u201cI should like to rest tonight on this beautiful spot, where the river is making counterpoint upon the stones as accompaniment to the canto-fermo of the cool breezes.\u201d", "And instantly there appeared, under an oil-cloth tent, a couch of fine scarlet, with down mattresses, covered with a Spanish counterpane and sheets as light as a feather.", "Then he asked for something to eat, and in a trice there was set out a sideboard covered with silver and gold, fit for a prince, and under another tent a table was spread with viands, the savoury smell of which extended a hundred miles.", "When he had eaten enough, he laid himself down to sleep; and as soon as the Cock, who is the spy of the Sun, announced to his master that the Shades of Night were worn and wearied, and it was now time for him, like a skilful general, to fall upon their rear and make a slaughter of them, Lise opened his little box and said, \u201cI wish to have a handsome dress, for today I shall see my brother, and I should like to make his mouth water.\u201d", "No sooner said than done: immediately a princely dress of the richest black velvet appeared, with edgings of red camlet and a lining of yellow cloth embroidered all over, which looked like a field of flowers.", "So dressing himself, Lise got into the litter and soon reached his brother\u2019s house.", "When Cianne saw his brother arrive, with all this splendour and luxury, he wished to know what good fortune had befallen him.", "Then Lise told him of the youths whom he had met in the inn, and of the present they had made him; but he kept to himself his conversation with the youths.", "Cianne was now all impatience to get away from his brother, and told him to go and rest himself, as he was no doubt tired: then he started post-haste, and soon arrived at the inn, where, finding the same youths, he fell into chat with them.", "And when the youth asked him the same question, what he thought of that month of March, Cianne, making a big mouth, said, \u201cConfound the miserable month!\u2014the enemy of the shepherds, which stirs up all the ill-humours and brings sickness to our bodies,\u2014a month of which, whenever we would announce ruin to a man, we say, \u2018Go, March has shaved you!\u2019\u2014a month of which, when you want to call a man presumptuous, you say, \u2018What cares March?\u2019Che ceusa Marzo?", "I do not understand this.\u2014a month in short so hateful, that it would be the best fortune for the world, the greatest blessing to the earth, the greatest gain to men, were it excluded from the band of brothers.\u201d", "March, who heard himself thus slandered, suppressed his anger till the morning, intending then to reward Cianne for his calumny; and when Cianne wished to depart, he gave him a fine whip, saying to him, \u201cWhenever you wish for anything, only say, \u2018Whip, give me a hundred!\u2019", "and you shall see pearls strung upon a rush.\u201d", "Cianne, thanking the youth, went his way in great haste, not wishing to make trial of the whip until he reached home.", "But hardly had he set foot in the house, when he went into a secret chamber, intending to hide the money which he expected to receive from the whip.", "Then he said, \u201cWhip, give me a hundred!\u201d", "and thereupon the whip gave him more than he looked for, making counterpoint on his legs and face like a musical composer, so that Lise, hearing his cries, came running to the spot; and when he saw that the whip, like a runaway horse, could not stop itself, he opened the little box and brought it to a stand-still.", "Then he asked Cianne what had happened to him, and upon hearing his story, he told him he had no one to blame but himself; for like a blockhead he alone had caused his own misfortune, acting like the camel, that wanted to have horns and lost its ears; but he bade him mind another time and keep a bridle on his tongue, which was the key that had opened to him the storehouse of misfortune; for if he had spoken well of the youths, he would perhaps have had the same good fortune, especially as to speak well of any one is a merchandise that costs nothing, and usually brings profit that is not expected.", "In conclusion Lise comforted him, bidding him not seek more wealth than Heaven had given him, for his little casket would suffice to fill the houses of thirty misers, and Cianne should be master of all he possessed, since to the generous man Heaven is  ; and he added that, although another brother might have borne Cianne ill-will for the cruelty with which he had treated him in his poverty, yet he reflected that his avarice had been a favourable wind which had brought him to this port, and therefore wished to show himself grateful for the benefit.", "When Cianne heard these things, he begged his brother's pardon for his past unkindness, and entering into partnership they enjoyed together their good fortune, and from that time forward Cianne spoke well of everything, however bad it might be; for", "\u201cThe dog that is scalded with hot water, has ever", "after a dread of cold water.\u201d", "When Cecca had finished her story, with which all were extremely pleased, Meneca, who was on thorns to disburden hers,

one voice called me a Venus.", "I now perceive that I am a victim to that name.", "I submit.", "Lead me to that rock to which my unhappy fate has destined me.\"", "Accordingly, all things being

pieces.", "Psyche meanwhile wandered day and night, without food or repose, in search of her husband.", "Casting her eyes on a lofty mountain having on its brow a magnificent temple, she sighed and

breathing odors and crowned with roses.", "Seeing the task done, she exclaimed, \"This is no work of yours, wicked one, but his, whom to your own and his misfortune you have enticed.\"", "So saying, she threw her a piece of black bread for her supper and went away.", "Next morning Venus ordered Psyche to be called and said to her, \"Behold yonder grove which stretches along the margin of the water.", "There you will find sheep feeding without a shepherd, with golden-shining fleeces on their backs.", "Go, fetch me a sample of that precious wool gathered from every one of their fleeces.\"", "Psyche obediently went to the riverside, prepared to do her best to execute the command.", "But the river god inspired the reeds with harmonious murmurs, which seemed to say, \"O maiden, severely tried, tempt not the dangerous flood, nor venture among the formidable rams on the other side, for as long as they are under the influence of the rising sun, they burn with a cruel rage to destroy mortals with their sharp horns or rude teeth.", "But when the noontide sun has driven the cattle to the shade, and the serene spirit of the flood has lulled them to rest, you may then cross in safety, and you will find the woolly gold sticking to the bushes and the trunks of the trees.\"", "Thus the compassionate river god gave Psyche instructions how to accomplish her task, and by observing his directions she soon returned to Venus with her arms full of the golden fleece; but she received not the approbation of her implacable mistress, who said, \"I know very well it is by none of your own doings that you have succeeded in this task, and I am not satisfied yet that you have any capacity to make yourself useful.", "But I have another task for you.", "Here, take this box and go your way to the infernal shades, and give this box to Proserpine and say, 'My mistress Venus desires you to send her a little of your beauty, for in tending her sick son she has lost some of her own.'", "Be not too long on your errand, for I must paint myself with it to appear at the circle of the gods and goddesses this evening.\"", "Psyche was now satisfied that her destruction was at hand, being obliged to go with her own feet directly down to Erebus.", "Wherefore, to make no delay of what was not to be avoided, she goes to the top of a high tower to precipitate herself headlong, thus to descend the shortest way to the shades below.", "But a voice from the tower said to her, \"Why, poor unlucky girl, dost thou design to put an end to thy days in so dreadful a manner?", "And what cowardice makes thee sink under this last danger who hast been so miraculously supported in all thy former?\"", "Then the voice told her how by a certain cave she might reach the realms of Pluto, and how to avoid all the dangers of the road, to pass by Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and prevail on Charon, the ferryman, to take her across the black river and bring her back again.", "But the voice added, \"When Proserpine has given you the box filled with her beauty, of all things this is chiefly to be observed by you, that you never once open or look into the box nor allow your curiosity to pry into the treasure of the beauty of the goddesses.\"", "Psyche, encouraged by this advice, obeyed it in all things, and taking heed to her ways travelled safely to the kingdom of Pluto.", "She was admitted to the palace of Proserpine, and without accepting the delicate seat or delicious banquet that was offered her, but contented with coarse bread for her food, she delivered her message from Venus.", "Presently the box was returned to her, shut and filled with the precious commodity.", "Then she returned the way she came, and glad was she to come out once more into the light of day.", "But having got so far successfully through her dangerous task, a longing desire seized her to examine the contents of the box.", "\"What,\" said she, \"shall I, the carrier of this divine beauty, not take the least bit to put on my cheeks to appear to more advantage in the eyes of my beloved husband!\"", "So she carefully opened the box, but found nothing there of any beauty at all, but an infernal and truly Stygian sleep, which being thus set free from its prison, took possession of her, and she fell down in the midst of the road, a sleepy corpse without sense or motion.", "But Cupid, being now recovered from his wound, and not able longer to bear the absence of his beloved Psyche, slipping through the smallest crack of the window of his chamber which happened to be left open, flew to the spot where Psyche lay, and gathering up the sleep from her body closed it again in the box, and waked Psyche with a light touch of one of his arrows.", "\"Again,\" said he, \"hast thou almost perished by the same curiosity.", "But now perform exactly the task imposed on you by my mother, and I will take care of the rest.\"", "Then Cupid, as swift as lightning penetrating the heights of heaven, presented himself before Jupiter with his supplication.", "Jupiter lent a favoring ear, and pleaded the cause of the lovers so earnestly with Venus that he won her consent.", "On this he sent Mercury to bring Psyche up to the heavenly assembly, and when she arrived, handing her a cup of ambrosia, he said, \"Drink this, Psyche, and be immortal; nor shall Cupid ever break away from the knot in which he is tied, but these nuptials shall be perpetual.\"", "Thus Psyche became at last united to Cupid, and in due time they had a daughter born to them whose name was Pleasure"], "bn_03526381n":

said he would just go to another place to see if he could get one there.", "As he went, a poor man met him, who asked him where he was going.", "He said he was going to see if he could get a godfather, that he was poor, so no one would stand as godfather for him.", "\"Oh,\" said the poor man, \"you are poor, and I am poor; I will be godfather for you, but I am so ill off", "I can give the child nothing.", "Go home and tell the nurse that she is to come to the church with the child.\"", "When they all got to the church together, the beggar was already there, and he gave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful.", "When he was going out of the church, the beggar said, \"Now go home, I can give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing.\"", "But he gave a key to the nurse, and told her when she got home she was to give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child was fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where there was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was therein should belong to him.", "Now when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he once went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that he had got more from his godfather than the other; but the child could say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his father, \"Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?\"", "\"Oh, yes,\" said the father, \"thou hadst a key\u2014if there is a castle  standing on the heath, just go to it and open it.\"", "Then the boy went thither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of.", "After seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went thither, and there stood the castle.", "When he had opened it, there was nothing within but a horse,\u2014a white one.", "Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father.", "\"Now I have a white horse, and I will travel,\" said he.", "So he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road.", "At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, \"Thou shouldst leave it lying there; thou wilt easily find a pen where thou art going, if thou hast need of one.\"", "As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, \"Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with thee.\"", "He looked around, but saw no one, then he went back again and picked it up.", "When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, \"Wait, my dear fish, I will help thee to get into the water,\" and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake.", "Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, \"As thou hast helped me out of the mud I will give thee a flute; when thou art in any need, play on it, and then I will help thee, and if ever thou lettest anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to thee.\"", "Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going.", "\"Oh, to the next place.\"", "Then what his name was?", "\"Ferdinand the Faithful.\"", "\"So!", "then we have got almost the same name, I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful.\"", "And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place.", "Now it was unfortunate that Ferdinand the Unfaithful knew everything that the other had ever thought and every thing he was about to do; he knew it by means of all kinds of wicked arts.", "There was, however, in the inn an honest girl, who had a bright face and behaved very prettily.", "She fell in love with Ferdinand the Faithful because he was a handsome man, and she asked him whither he was going.", "\"Oh, I am just travelling round about,\" said he.", "Now when the King met his lords in the morning, he always lamented and said, \"Oh, if I had but my love with me.\"", "Ferdinand the Unfaithful was, however, always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful.", "So once, when the King was complaining thus, he said, \"You have the outrider, send him away to get her, and if he does not do it, his head must be struck off.\"", "Then the King sent for Ferdinand the Faithful, and told him that there was, in this place or in that place, a girl he loved, and that he was to bring her to him, and if he did not do it he should die.", "Ferdinand the Faithful went into the stable to his white horse, and complained and lamented \"Oh, what an unhappy man I am!\"", "Then some one behind him cried, \"Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?\"", "He looked round but saw no one, and went on lamenting; \"Oh, my dear little white horse, now must I leave thee; now must I die.\"", "Then some one cried once more, \"Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?\"", "Then for the first time he was aware that it was his little white horse who was putting that question.", "\"Dost thou speak, my little white horse; canst thou do that?\"", "And again, he said, \"I am to go to this place and to that, and am to bring the bride; canst thou tell me how I am to set about it?\"", "Then answered the little white horse, \"Go thou to the King, and say if he will give thee what thou must have, thou wilt get her for him.", "If he will give thee a ship full of meat, and a ship full of bread, it will succeed.", "Great giants dwell on the lake, and if thou takest no meat with thee for them, they will tear thee to pieces, and there are the large birds which would pick the eyes out of thy head if thou hadst no bread for them.\"", "Then the King made all the butchers in the land kill, and all the bakers bake, that the ships might be filled.", "When they were full, the little white horse said to Ferdinand the Faithful, \"Now mount me, and go with me into the ship, and then when the giants come, say,", "\"Peace, peace, my dear little giants,", "I have had thought of ye,", "Something I have brought for ye;\"", "and when the birds come, thou shalt again say,", "\"Peace, peace, my dear little birds,", "I have had thought of ye,", "Something I have brought for ye;\"", "then they will do nothing to thee, and when thou comest to the castle, the giants will help thee.",

the ship.\"", "And now everything took place as the little white horse had said, and Ferdinand the Faithful gave the giants and the birds what he had brought with him for them, and that made the giants willing, and they carried the princess in her bed to the King.", "And when she came to the King, she said she could not live, she must have her writings, they had been left in her castle.", "Then by the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, Ferdinand the Faithful was called, and the King told him he must fetch the writings from the castle, or he should die.", "Then he went once more into the stable, and bemoaned himself and said, \"Oh, my dear little white horse, now I am to go away again, how am I to do it?\"", "Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again.", "So it happened again as it had happened before, and the giants and the birds were satisfied, and The Queen, however, did not love the King because he had no nose, but she would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful.", "Once, therefore, when all the lords of the court were together, the Queen said she could do feats of magic, that she could cut off any one's head and put it on again, and that one of them ought just to try it.", "But none of them would be the first, so Ferdinand the Faithful, again at the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, undertook it", "and she hewed off his head, and put it on again for him, and it healed together directly, so that it looked as if he had a red thread round his throat.", "Then the King said to her, \"My child, and where hast thou learnt that?\"", "\"Yes,\" she said, \"I understand the art; shall I just try it on thee also?\"", "\"Oh, yes,\" said he.", "But she cut off his head, and did not put it on again; but pretended that she could not get it on, and that it would not keep fixed.", "Then the King was buried, but she married Ferdinand the Faithful.", "He, however, always rode on his white horse, and once when he was seated on it, it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he knew, and gallop three times round it.", "And when he had done that, the white horse stood up on its hind legs, and was changed

indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town.", "This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days.", "Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic.", "Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world.", "A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.", "I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley.", "I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.", "If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.", "From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country.", "A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere.", "Some say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson.", "Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie.", "They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air.", "The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.", "The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head.", "It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind.", "His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance.", "Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.", "Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.", "It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time.", "However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.", "I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain fixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved.", "They are like those little nooks of still water, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current.", "Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.", "In this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, \u201ctarried,\u201d  in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity.", "He was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters.", "The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person.", "He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together.", "His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew.", "To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.", "His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks.", "It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in getting out,--an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eelpot.", "The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it.", "From hence the low murmur of his pupils\u2019 voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard in a drowsy summer\u2019s day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge.", "Truth to say, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, \u201cSpare the rod and spoil the child.\u201d", "Ichabod Crane\u2019s scholars certainly were not spoiled.", "I would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong.", "Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch.", "All this he called \u201cdoing his duty by their parents;\u201d and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting urchin, that \u201che would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live.\u201d", "When school hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard.", "Indeed, it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils.", "The revenue arising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed.", "With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.", "That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable.", "He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make hay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from pasture, and cut wood for the winter fire.", "He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating.", "He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children, particularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.", "In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody.", "It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson.", "Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of the millpond, on a still Sunday morning, which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane.", "Thus, by divers little makeshifts, in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated \u201cby hook and by crook,\u201d the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.", "The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson.", "His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver teapot.", "Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels.", "How he would figure among them in the churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address.", "From his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction.", "He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather\u2019s \u201cHistory of New England Witchcraft,\u201d in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed.", "He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity.", "His appetite for the marvellous, and his powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell-bound region.", "No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow.", "It was often his delight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his schoolhouse, and there con over old Mather\u2019s direful tales, until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes.", "Then, as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,--the moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost.", "The fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch\u2019s token.", "His only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody, \u201cin linked sweetness long drawn out,\u201d  floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.", "Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him.", "He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!", "But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk homewards.", "What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path, amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night!", "With what wistful look did he eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window!", "How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path!", "How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him!", "And how often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly scourings!", "All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was--a woman.", "Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week, to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer.", "She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her father\u2019s peaches, and universally famed, not merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations.", "She was withal a little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off her charms.", "She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting stomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.", "Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion.", "Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer.", "He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned.", "He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived.", "His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling.", "A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows.", "Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof.", "Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air.", "A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry.", "Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart,--sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.", "The pedagogue\u2019s mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare.", "In his devouring mind\u2019s eye, he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce.", "In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.", "As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness.", "Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee,--or the Lord knows where!", "When he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete.", "It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather.", "Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river.", "Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted.", "From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence.", "Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes.", "In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.", "From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel.", "In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course.", "Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.", "Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood.", "He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance.", "From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known.", "He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar.", "He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal.", "He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom.", "He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round.", "In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox\u2019s tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall.", "Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, \u201cAy, there goes Brom Bones and his gang!\u201d", "The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.", "This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes.", "Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel\u2019s paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed, \u201csparking,\u201d within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.", "Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired.", "He had, however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack--yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away--jerk!--he was as erect, and carried his head as high as ever.", "To have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that stormy lover, Achilles.", "Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner.", "Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers.", "Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her have her way in everything.", "His notable little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves.", "Thus, while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn.", "In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover\u2019s eloquence.", "I profess not to know how women\u2019s hearts are wooed and won.", "To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration.", "Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways.", "It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window.", "He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero.", "Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently declined: his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.", "Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore,--by single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would \u201cdouble the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse;\u201d and he was too wary to give him an opportunity.", "There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival.", "Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders.", "They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there.", "But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod\u2019s, to instruct her in psalmody.", "In this way matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers.", "On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm.", "In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper gamecocks.", "Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom.", "It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter.", "He came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or \u201cquilting frolic,\u201d to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel\u2019s; and having delivered his message with that air of importance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.", "All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom.", "The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word.", "Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.", "The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse.", "That he might make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the name of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like a knight-errant in quest of adventures.", "But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed.", "The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its viciousness.", "He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it.", "Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder.", "He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master\u2019s, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country.", "Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed.", "He rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers\u2019; he carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings.", "A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail.", "Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad daylight.", "It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day; the sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance.", "The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet.", "Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory-nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble field.", "The small birds were taking their farewell banquets.", "In the fullness of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around them.", "There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker with his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his gay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove.", "As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn.", "On all sides he beheld vast store of apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press.", "Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.", "Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and \u201csugared suppositions,\u201d he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson.", "The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down in the west.", "The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain.", "A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them.", "The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven.", "A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides.", "A sloop was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging uselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air.", "It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country.", "Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles.", "Their brisk, withered little dames, in close-crimped caps, long-waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside.", "Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation.", "The sons, in short square-skirted coats, with rows of stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.", "Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the gathering on his favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage.", "He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for he held a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.", "Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van Tassel\u2019s mansion.", "Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time of autumn.", "Such heaped up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced Dutch housewives!", "There was the doughty doughnut, the tender oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of cakes.", "And then there were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the midst--Heaven bless the mark!", "I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story.", "Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.", "He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with eating, as some men\u2019s do with drink.", "He could not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor.", "Then, he thought, how soon he\u2019d turn his back upon the old schoolhouse; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him comrade!", "Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated with content and good humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon.", "His hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to \u201cfall to, and help themselves.\u201d", "And now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned to the dance.", "The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century.", "His instrument was as old and battered as himself.", "The greater part of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the ground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.", "Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal powers.", "Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you would have thought St. Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person.", "He was the admiration of all the negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear.", "How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous?", "The lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.", "When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the sager folks, who, with Old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about the war.", "This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men.", "The British and American line had run near it during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees, cowboys, and all kinds of border chivalry.", "Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.", "There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge.", "And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White Plains, being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small sword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and glance off at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show the sword, with the hilt a little bent.", "There were several more that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination.", "But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded.", "The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind.", "Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered, long-settled retreats; but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places.", "Besides, there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon.", "This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch communities.", "The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow.", "There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land.", "Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel\u2019s, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends.", "Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major Andr\u00e9 was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood.", "Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow.", "The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.", "The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits.", "It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement.", "A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson.", "To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace.", "On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees.", "Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night.", "Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered.", "The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the Horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.", "This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey.", "He affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire.", "All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of Ichabod.", "He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken place in his native State of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.", "The revel now gradually broke up.", "The old farmers gathered together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills.", "Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter, until they gradually died away,--and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted.", "Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the heiress; fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success.", "What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know.", "Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen.", "Oh, these women!", "these women!", "Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?", "Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival?", "Heaven only knows, not I!", "Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair lady\u2019s heart.", "Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.", "It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and crestfallen, pursued his travels homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon.", "The hour was as dismal as himself.", "Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land.", "In the dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man.", "Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse away among the hills--but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear.", "No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed.", "All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection.", "The night grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight.", "He had never felt so lonely and dismal.", "He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid.", "In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark.", "Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air.", "It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate Andr\u00e9, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major Andr\u00e9\u2019s tree.", "The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.", "As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches.", "As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused and ceased whistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare.", "Suddenly he heard a groan--his teeth chattered, and his knees smote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were swayed about by the breeze.", "He passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.", "About two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley\u2019s Swamp.", "A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream.", "On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it.", "To pass this bridge was the severest trial.", "It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate Andr\u00e9 was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him.", "This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.", "As he approached the stream, his heart began to thump; he summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence.", "Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes.", "The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head.", "Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod.", "In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen and towering.", "It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.", "The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror.", "What was to be done?", "To turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind?", "Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in stammering accents, \u201cWho are you?\u201d", "He received no reply.", "He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice.", "Still there was no answer.", "Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune.", "Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at once in the middle of the road.", "Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained.", "He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame.", "He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.", "Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind.", "The stranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace.", "Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind,--the other did the same.", "His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave.", "There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling.", "It was soon fearfully accounted for.", "On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless!--but his horror was still more increased on observing that the head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of his saddle!", "His terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion the slip; but the spectre started full jump with him.", "Away, then, they dashed through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound.", "Ichabod\u2019s flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse\u2019s head, in the eagerness of his flight.", "They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong downhill to the left.", "This road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story; and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.", "As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chase, but just as he had got half way through the hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt it slipping from under him.", "He seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer.", "For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper\u2019s wrath passed across his mind,--for", "it was his Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his haunches; and (unskilful rider that he was!)", "he had much ado to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse\u2019s backbone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.", "An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand.", "The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken.", "He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond.", "He recollected the place where Brom Bones\u2019s ghostly competitor had disappeared.", "\u201cIf I can but reach that bridge,\u201d thought Ichabod, \u201cI am safe.\u201d", "Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath.", "Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone.", "Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him.", "Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late.", "It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash,--he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.", "The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master\u2019s gate.", "Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod.", "The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster.", "Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his saddle.", "An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces.", "In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses\u2019 hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.", "The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered.", "Hans Van Ripper as executor of his estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects.", "They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes full of dog\u2019s-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe.", "As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather\u2019s \u201cHistory of Witchcraft,\u201d a \u201cNew England Almanac,\u201d and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel.", "These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper; who, from that time forward, determined to send his children no more to school, observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing.", "Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter\u2019s pay but a day or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.", "The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following Sunday.", "Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found.", "The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian.", "As he was a bachelor, and in nobody\u2019s debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him; the school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and another pedagogue reigned in his stead.", "It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same time; had been admitted to the bar; turned politician; electioneered; written for the newspapers; and finally had been made a justice of the Ten Pound Court.", "Brom Bones, too, who, shortly after his rival\u2019s disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.", "The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire.", "The bridge became more than ever an object of superstitious awe; and that may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the border of the millpond.", "The schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue and the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow"], "bn_03884049n": ["It always happens that he who is over-curious in prying into the affairs of other people strikes his own foot with the axe; and the King of Long Furrow is a proof of this, who, by poking his nose into secrets, brought his daughter into trouble, and ruined his unhappy son-in-law, who, in attempting to make a thrust with his head, was left with his head broken.", "There was once on a time a gardener's wife, who longed to have a son more than the suitor longs for a sentence in his favour, a sick man for cold water, or the innkeeper for the arrival of the mail-coach.", "It chanced one day that the poor man went to the mountain to get a faggot; and when he came home and opened it, he found a pretty little serpent among the twigs.", "At the sight of this, Sapatella (for that was the name of the gardener's wife) heaved a deep sigh and said, \"Alas!", "even the serpents have their little  ; but I brought ill-luck with me into this world.\"", "At these words the little serpent spoke, and said, \"Well then, since you cannot have children, take me for a child, and you will make a good bargain, for I shall love you better than my own mother.\"", "Sapatella, hearing a serpent speak thus, had like to have fainted; but plucking up courage she said, \"If it were for nothing else than for the affection which you offer, I am content to take you, and treat you as if you were really my own child.\"", "So saying, she assigned him a hole in a corner of the house for a cradle, and gave him for food a share of what she had, with the greatest affection in the world.", "The serpent increased in size from day to day; and when he was grown pretty big, he said to Cola Matteo, the gardener, whom he looked upon as his father, \"Daddy, I want to get married.", "\"\u2014\"With all my heart", ",\" said Cola Matteo; \"we must look out for another serpent like yourself, and try to make up a match between you.", "\"\u2014\"What serpent are you talking of?\" said the little serpent: \"I suppose, forsooth, we are all the same with the vipers and adders!", "It is easy to see you are nothing but an Antony, and make a nosegay of every plant.", "I want the king's daughter; so go this very instant and ask the king for her, and tell him it is a serpent that demands her.\"", "Cola Matteo, who was a plain, straightforward sort of man, and knew nothing about matters of this kind, went innocently to the king and delivered his message, saying, \"The messenger should not be beaten more, than the sands upon the shore.", "Know then that a serpent wants your daughter for his wife, and I am come therefore to try if we can make a match between a serpent and a dove.\"", "The king, who saw at a glance that he was a blockhead, to get rid of him said, \"Go and tell the serpent that I will give him my daughter if he turns all the fruit of this orchard into gold.\"", "And so saying, he burst out a-laughing and dismissed him.", "When Cola Matteo went home, and delivered the answer to the serpent, he said, \"Go tomorrow morning and gather up all the fruit-stones you can find in the city, and sow them in the orchard, and you will see pearls strung on rushes.\"", "Cola Matteo, who was no conjuror, neither knew how to comply or refuse; so next morning, as soon as the Sun with his golden broom had swept away the dirt of the Night from the fields watered by the Dawn, he took a basket on his arm, and went from street to street picking up all the stones of peaches, plums, nectarines, apricots and cherries that he could find: then he went to the orchard of the palace, and sowed them as the serpent had desired.", "In an instant the trees shot up, and stems and branches, leaves, flowers and fruit, were all of glistening gold; at the sight of which the king was in an ecstasy of amazement, and cried aloud with joy.", "But when Cola Matteo was sent by the serpent to the king to demand the performance of his promise, the king said, \"Fair and easy, I must first have something else, if he would have my daughter; and it is that he make all the walls and the ground in the orchard to be of precious stones.\"", "When the gardener told this to the serpent, he made answer, \"Go tomorrow morning and gather up all the bits of broken crockery-ware you can find, and throw them on the walks, and on the wall of the orchard, for we will not let this difficulty stand in our way.\"", "As soon therefore as the Night, having stood by and backed the robbers, is banished from the sky, and goes about collecting the faggots of twilight.", "Cola Matteo took a basket under his arm, and went about collecting bits of tiles, lids and bottoms of pipkins, pieces of plates and dishes, handles of jugs, spouts of pitchers; picking up all the spoilt, broken, flawed, cracked lamps, and all the fragments of pottery of every sort he could find in his way.", "And when he had done all that the serpent had told him, there was to be seen the whole orchard mantled with emeralds and chalcedonies, and coated with rubies and carbuncles, in such sort, that the lustre sequestered the sight in the warehouses of the eyes, and planted admiration in the fields of the heart.", "The king was struck all of a heap at the sight, and knew not what had befallen him.", "But when the serpent sent again to let him know that he was expecting the performance of his promise, the king answered, \"Oh!", "all that has been done is nothing, if he does not turn this palace into gold.\"", "When Cola Matteo told the serpent this new fancy of the king's, the serpent said, \"Go and get a bundle of herbs of different kinds, and rub the bottom of the palace walls with them: we shall see if we cannot satisfy this whim.\"", "Away went Cola Matteo that very moment, and made a great broom of cabbages, radishes, rockets, purslain, turnips and carrots; and when he had rubbed the lower part of the palace with it, instantly you might see it shining like a gilded pill to purge melancholy from a hundred houses that were ill-treated by fortune.", "And when the gardener came again to demand the princess to wife in the name of the serpent, the king, seeing all retreat cut off, called his daughter, and said to her, \"My dear Grannonia, I have endeavoured to get rid of a suitor who asked you for his wife, by making such conditions as seemed to me impossible; but seeing myself foiled, and obliged to consent I know not how, I pray you, as you are a dutiful daughter, to enable me to keep my word, and to be content with what Heaven wills and I am obliged to do.\"", "\"Do as you please, papa,\" said Grannonia; \"I shall not oppose a single jot of your will.\"", "The king hearing this bade Cola Matteo tell the serpent to come.", "The serpent, on receiving the invitation, set out for the palace mounted on a car all of gold, and drawn by four golden elephants.", "But wherever he came the people fled away in terror, at seeing such a large and frightful serpent making his progress through the city: and when he arrived at the palace, the courtiers all trembled like rushes, and ran away, and even the very scullions did not dare to stay in the place.", "The king and queen also, shivering with fear, crept into a chamber, and Grannonia alone stood her ground; for though her father and her mother kept crying out, \"Fly, fly, Grannonia!", "save yourself, RienzoThis apparently alludes to the fate of Cola Rienzo (Nicola di Lorenzo), the Roman patriot, which may have become proverbial.\u2014K.!\u201d", "she would not stir from the spot, saying, \"Why should I fly from the husband whom you have given me?\"", "And when the serpent came into the room, he took Grannonia by the waist in his tail, and gave her such a shower of kisses, that the king writhed like a worm; and I warrant, if he had been bled, not a single drop of blood would have come.", "Then the serpent carried her into another room, and fastened the door; and shaking off his skin on the ground, he became a most beautiful youth, with a head all covered with ringlets of gold, and with eyes that would enchant you.", "When the king saw the serpent going into the room with his daughter, and shutting the door after him, he said to his wife, \"Heaven have mercy on that good soul my daughter!", "for she is dead to a certainty, and that accursed serpent has doubtless swallowed her down like the yolk of an egg!\"", "Then he put his eye to the keyhole, to see what had become of her; but when he saw the exceeding beauty of the youth, and the skin of the serpent that he had left lying on the ground, he gave the door a kick; then in they rushed, and taking the skin flung it into the fire and burned it.", "When the youth saw this, he cried out, \"Ah you renegade dogs, you have done for me!\"", "and instantly he turned himself into a dove, and was going to fly away through the window; but he struck his head against the panes until he broke them, and cut himself in such a manner that there did not remain a whole spot on his pate.", "Grannonia, who thus saw herself at the same moment happy and unhappy, joyful and miserable, rich and poor, tore her face and bewailed her fate, reproaching her father and mother for this interruption of pleasure, this poisoning of sweets, this overthrow of good-fortune; but they excused themselves, declaring that they had not meant to do harm.", "But Grannonia went on weeping and wailing, until Night came forth to illuminate the catafalque of the sky for the funeral pomp of the Sun; and when she saw that all were in bed, she took her jewels, which were in a writing-desk, and went out by a back-door, intending to search everywhere till she found the treasure she had lost.", "So she went out of the city, guided by the light of the moon, and on her way she met a fox, who asked her if she wished for company.", "\"Of all things, my friend,\" answered Grannonia, \"I should be delighted, for I am not over-well acquainted with the country.\"", "So they travelled along together till they came to a wood, where the trees, at play like children, were making baby-houses for the shadows to lie in; and being now wearied with their journey, and wishing to repose, they retired to the covert of the leaves, where a fountain was playing carnival pranks with the green grass, flinging the water on it by dishfuls; and stretching themselves on a mattress of tender soft grass, they paid the duty of repose which they owed to Nature for the merchandize of life.", "They did not awake till the Sun, with his usual fire, gave the signal to sailors and couriers to set out on their road; and after they awoke, they still stayed for some time listening to the singing of the various birds, for Grannonia showed great pleasure in hearing the warbling and twittering they made; and the fox seeing this, said to her, \"You would feel twice as much pleasure if you understood, like me, what they are saying.\"", "At these words Grannonia\u2014for women are by nature as curious as they are talkative\u2014begged the fox to tell her what he had heard the birds saying in their own language.", "So after having let her entreat him for a long time, in order to raise her curiosity about what he was going to relate, he told her that the birds were talking to one another of what had lately befallen the king's son, who was as beautiful as a fay, and because he would not comply with the wishes of a wicked ogress, had been laid under a spell by her magic power to pass seven years in the form of a serpent; that he had nearly ended the seven years, when he fell in love with the daughter of a king; and being one day in a room with the maiden, and having cast his skin on the ground, her father and mother, out of curiosity, rushed in and burned his skin; whereupon as the prince was flying away in the shape of a dove, he broke a pane in the window to escape, and had hurt his head in such a manner that he was given over by the doctors.", "Grannonia, who thus heard her own onions spoken of, first of all asked whose son this prince was, and then if there was any hope of cure for his accident.", "And the fox replied, that the birds had said his father was the king of Big Valley, and that there was no other secret for stopping the holes in his skull, to prevent his soul getting out at them, than to anoint his wounds with the blood of those very birds who had been telling the story.", "When Grannonia heard these words, she fell down on her knees to the fox, entreating of him to oblige her by catching those birds for her, that she might get their blood; adding, that then, like honest comrades, they would share the gain.", "\"Fair and softly,\" said the fox, \"let us wait till night, and when the birds are gone to bed, let your mammy alone, for I will climb up the tree and weasen them one after another.\"", "So they passed the whole day, talking one time of the beauty of the young prince, then of the mistake made by the maiden's father, then of the mishap that had befallen the prince, chatting and chatting away till Day was gone, and Earth had spread out her large black piece of pasteboard, to collect the wax that might drop from the tapers of Night.", "Then the fox, as soon as he saw all the birds fast asleep on the branches, stole up quite softly, and, one after another, throttled all the linnets, larks, tomtits, blackbirds, woodpeckers, thrushes, jays, flycatchers, little owls, goldfinches, bullfinches, chaffinches and redbreasts that were on the trees.", "And when he had killed them all, they put the blood into a little bottle which the fox carried with him to refresh himself on the road.", "Grannonia was so overjoyed that she hardly touched the ground; but the fox said to her, \"What fine joy in a dream is this, my daughter!", "you have done nothing unless you have my blood also to mix with that of the birds;\" and so saying he set off running away.", "Grannonia, who saw all her hopes destroyed, had recourse to women's art, cunning and flattery; and she said to him, \"Gossip fox, there would be some reason for your saving your hide if I were not under so many obligations to you, and if there were no other foxes in the world; but as you know how much I owe you, and know also that there is no scarcity of the like of you in these plains, you may rely on my good faith.", "So don't act like the cow that kicks down the pad when she has just filled it with milk.", "You have done the chief part, and now you fail at the best.", "Do stop; believe me, and come with me to the city of this king, where you may sell me for a slave if you will.\"", "The fox, who never dreamed that the quintessence of foxery was to be met with, found himself out-foxed by a woman.", "So he agreed to travel on with  ; but they had hardly gone fifty paces, when she lifted up the stick she carried, and gave him with it such a neat rap that he forthwith stretched his legs.", "Then cutting his throat, she quickly took the blood and poured it into the little bottle; and setting off again, she stopped not until she came to Big Valley, where she went straightway to the royal palace, and sent word to the king that she was come to cure the prince.", "Then the king ordered her to come into his presence, and he was astonished at seeing a girl undertake a thing which the best doctors in his kingdom had failed to do: however, as a trial could do no harm, he said that he wished greatly to see the experiment made.", "But Grannonia answered, \"If I show you the effect that you desire, you must promise to give him to me for a husband.\"", "The king, who looked upon his son to be all one as dead, answered her, \"If you give him to me safe and sound, I will give him to you sound and safe; for it is no great matter to give a husband to her who gives me a son.\"", "So they went to the chamber of the prince, and hardly had she anointed him with the blood, when he found himself just as if nothing had ever ailed him.", "And Grannonia, when she saw the prince stout and hearty, bade the king keep his word; whereupon the king turning round to his son said, \"My son, a moment ago you were all but dead, and now I see you alive, and can hardly believe it.", "Therefore, as I have promised this maiden, that if she cured you she should have you for a husband, now that Heaven has shown you favour, enable me to perform my promise, by all the love you bear me, since gratitude obliges me to pay this debt.\"", "When the prince heard these words he replied, \"Sir, I would that I had such freedom of my will as to prove to you the love I bear you; but as I have already pledged my faith to another woman, you would not consent that I should break my word, nor would this maiden wish me to do such a wrong to her whom I love; nor can I indeed alter my mind.\"", "Grannonia, hearing this, felt a secret pleasure not to be described at finding herself still alive in the memory of the prince; her whole face became crimson, and she said, \"If I should induce this maiden whom you love to resign her claims to me, would you then consent to my wish?\"\u2014\"Never,\" replied the prince, never will I banish from this breast the fair image of her I love; and whether she makes for me a conserve of her love, or gives me a dose of cassia, I shall ever remain of the same mind and will; and I would sooner see myself in danger of losing my place at the table of life, than play such a trick or make this exchange.\"", "Grannonia could no longer remain in the trammels of disguise, and discovered to the prince who she was; for the chamber being darkened on account of the wounds in his head, and she being disguised, he had not known her.", "But the prince, now that he recognized her, embraced her with a joy that would amaze you, telling his father who she was, and what he had done and suffered for her.", "Then they sent to invite her parents, the king and queen of Long-Field, and they celebrated the wedding with wonderful festivity, making great sport of the ninny of a fox, and concluding at the last of the last, that", "Pain doth indeed a seasoning prove", "Unto the joys of constant love.\"", "From beginning to end Popa's story made the women laugh outright; but where it spoke of their cunning, which was sufficient to outwit a fox, they were near bursting their sides.", "And truly woman has artful devices strung like beads by hundreds on every hair of her head: fraud is her mother, falsehood is her nurse, flattery her governess, deceit her counsellor, and illusion her companion, so that she turns and twists man about just as she pleases.", "But let us return to Antonella, who was impatient to speak; and presently, after mustering her thoughts, she spoke as follows"], "bn_21706209n": ["THERE was a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all over with gold.", "But this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard, which made him so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him.", "One of his neighbours, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties.", "He desired of her one of them in marriage, leaving to her choice which of the two she would bestow on him.", "They would neither of them have him, and sent him backwards and forwards from one another, not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man who had a blue beard, and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having already been married to several wives, and nobody ever knew what became of them.", "Blue Beard, to engage their affection, took them, with the lady their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, with other young people of the neighbourhood, to one of his country seats, where they stayed a whole week.", "There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting.", "Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other.", "In short, every thing succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue, and that he was a mighty civil gentleman.", "As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded.", "About a month afterwards, Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, about affairs of very great consequence, desiring her to divert herself in his absence, to send for her friends and acquaintances, to carry them into the country, if she pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was.", "\u2018Here,\u2019 said he, \u2018are the keys of the two great wardrobes, wherein I have my best furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which is not every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments.", "But for this little one here, it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor.", "Open them all; go into all and every one of them, except that little closet, which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a manner that, if you happen to open it, there\u2019s nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment.\u2019", "She promised to observe, very exactly, whatever he had ordered; when he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey.", "Her neighbours and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady, so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard, which frightened them.", "They ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another.", "After that they went up into the two great rooms, where were the best and richest furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot; some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the finest and most magnificent ever were seen.", "They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend, who in the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things, because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor.", "She was so much pressed by her curiosity that, without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company, she went down a little back staircase, and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck.", "Being come to the closet-door, she made a stop for some time, thinking upon her husband\u2019s orders, and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it.", "She then took the little key, and opened it, trembling, but could not at first see anything plainly, because the windows were shut.", "After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood, on which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged against the walls.", "(These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after another.)", "She thought she should have died for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.", "After having somewhat recovered her surprise, she took up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself; but she could not, so much was she frightened.", "Having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off, but the blood would not come out; in vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand, the blood still remained, for the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.", "Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage.", "His wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return.", "Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.", "\u2018What!\u2019 said he, \u2018is not the key of my closet among the rest?\u2019", "\u2018I must certainly,\u2019 said she, \u2018have left it above upon the table.\u2019", "\u2018Fail not,\u2019 said Blue Beard, \u2018to bring it me presently.\u2019", "After several goings backwards and forwards she was forced to bring him the key.", "Blue Beard, having very attentively considered it, said to his wife, \u2018How comes this blood upon the key?\u2019", "\u2018I do not know,\u2019 cried the poor woman, paler than death.", "\u2018You do not know!\u2019 replied Blue Beard.", "\u2018I very well know.", "You were resolved to go into the closet, were you not?", "Mighty well, madam; you shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.\u2019", "Upon this she threw herself at her husband\u2019s feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of a true repentance, vowing that she would never more be disobedient.", "She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock!", "\u2018You must die, madam,\u2019 said he, \u2018and that presently.\u2019", "\u2018Since I must die,\u2019 answered she (looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears), \u2018give me some little time to say my prayers.\u2019", "\u2018I give you,\u2019 replied Blue Beard, \u2018half a quarter of an hour, but not one moment more.\u2019", "When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her: \u2018Sister Anne\u2019 (for that was her name), \u2018go up, I beg you, upon the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming; they promised me that they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste.\u2019", "Her sister Anne went up upon the top of the tower, and the poor afilicted wife cried out from time to time: \u2018Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?\u2019", "And sister Anne said: \u2018I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which looks green.\u2019", "In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife: \u2018Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.\u2019", "\u2018One moment longer, if you please,\u2019 said his wife; and then she cried out very softly, \u2018Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?\u2019", "And sister Anne answered: \u2018I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is green.\u2019", "\u2018Come down quickly,\u2019 cried Blue Beard, \u2018or I will come up to you.\u2019", "\u2018I am coming,\u2019 answered his wife; and then she cried, \u2018Anne, sister Anne, dost thou not see anyone coming?\u2019", "\u2018I see,\u2019 replied sister Anne, \u2018a great dust, which comes on this side here.\u2019", "\u2018Are they my brothers?\u2019", "\u2018Alas!", "no, my dear sister, I see a flock of sheep.\u2019", "\u2018Will you not come down?\u2019 cried Blue Beard.", "\u2018One moment longer,\u2019 said his wife, and then she cried out: \u2018Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?\u2019", "\u2018I see,\u2019 said she, \u2018two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.\u2019", "\u2018God be praised,\u2019 replied the poor wife joyfully: \u2018they are my brothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to make haste.\u2019", "Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble.", "The distressed wife came down, and threw herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders.", "\u2018This signifies nothing,\u2019 says Blue Beard; \u2018you must die\u2019; then, taking hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up the sword with the other, he was going to take off her head.", "The poor lady, turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself.", "\u2018No, no,\u2019 said he, \u2018recommend thyself to God,\u2019 and was just ready to strike  At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard made a sudden stop.", "The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, drawing their swords, ran directly to Blue Beard.", "He knew them to be his wife\u2019s brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer; so that he ran away immediately to save himself; but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch, when they ran their swords through his body and left him dead.", "The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers.", "Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate.", "She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buy captains\u2019 commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the ill time she had passed with Blue Beard"], "bn_14145915n": ["Once on a time there was a farmer who had three sons; his means were small, and he was old and weak, and his sons would take to nothing.", "A fine large wood belonged to the farm, and one day the father told his sons to go and hew wood, and try to pay off some of his debts.", "Well, after a long talk, he got them to set off, and the eldest was to go first.", "But when he had got well into the wood, and began to hew at a mossy old fir, what should he see coming up to him but a great sturdy Troll.", "\"If you hew in this wood of mine,\" said the Troll, \"I'll kill you!\"", "When the lad heard that, he threw the axe down, and ran off home as fast as he could lay legs to the ground; so he came in quite out of breath, and told them what had happened, but his father called him \"hare-heart,\"\u2014no Troll would ever have scared him from hewing when he was young, he said.", "Next day the second son's turn came, and he fared just the same.", "He had scarce hewn three strokes at the fir, before the Troll came to him too, and said\u2014 \"If you hew in this wood of mine, I'll kill you.\"", "The lad dared not so much as look at him, but threw down the axe, took to his heels, and came scampering home just like his brother.", "So when he got home, his father was angry again, and said no Troll had ever scared him when he was young.", "The third day Boots wanted to set off.", "\"You, indeed!\" said the two elder brothers; \"you'll do it bravely, no doubt!", "you, who have scarce ever set your foot out of the door.\"", "Boots said nothing to this, but only begged them to give him a good store of food.", "His mother had no cheese, so she set the pot on the fire to make him a little, and he put it into a scrip and set off.", "So when he had hewn a bit, the Troll came to him too, and said\u2014 \"If you hew in this wood of mine, I'll kill you.\"", "But the lad was not slow; he pulled his cheese out of the scrip in a trice, and squeezed it till the whey spurted out.", "\"Hold your tongue!\"", "he cried to the Troll, \"or I'll squeeze you as I squeeze the water out of this white stone.\"", "\"Nay, dear friend!\" said the Troll, \"only spare me, and I'll help you to hew.\"", "Well, on those terms the lad was willing to spare him, and the Troll hewed so bravely, that they felled and cut up many, many fathoms in the day.", "But when even drew near, the Troll said\u2014 \"Now you'd better come home with me, for my house is nearer than yours.\"", "So the lad was willing enough; and when they reached the Troll's house, the Troll was to make up the fire, while the lad went to fetch water for their porridge, and there stood two iron pails so big and heavy, that he couldn't so much as lift them from the ground.", "\"Pooh!\" said the lad, \"it isn't worth while to touch these finger-basins.", "I'll just go and fetch the spring itself.\"", "\"Nay, nay, dear friend!\" said the Troll; \"I can't afford to lose my spring; just you make up the fire, and I'll go and fetch the water.\"", "So when he came back with the water, they set to and boiled up a great pot of porridge.", "\"It's all the same to me,\" said the lad; \"but if you're of my mind, we'll eat a match!\"", "\"With all my heart,\" said the Troll, for he thought he could surely hold his own in eating.", "So they sat down; but the lad took his scrip unawares to the Troll, and hung it before him, and so he spooned more into the scrip than he ate himself; and when the scrip was full, he took up his knife and made a slit in the scrip.", "The Troll looked on all the while, but said never a word.", "So when they had eaten a good bit longer, the Troll laid down his spoon, saying, \"Nay!", "but I can't eat a morsel more.\"", "\"But you shall eat,\" said the youth; \"I'm only half done; why don't you do as I did, and cut a hole in your paunch?", "You'll be able to eat then as much as you please.\"", "\"But doesn't it hurt one cruelly?\" asked the Troll.", "\"Oh,\" said the youth, \"nothing to speak of.\"", "So the Troll did as the lad said, and then you must know very well that he lost his life; but the lad took all the silver and gold that he found in the hill-side, and went home with it, and you may fancy it went a great way to pay off the debt"]}
