He closed his eyes again, and the dream picture came back to him, the woman catching the little dog and raising her head as though to speak to him.", "bn_01789382n": "In that same village, and in one of these very houses (which, to tell the precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain, a simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle.", "bn_02439324n": "He was eight leagues tall, or 24,000 geometric paces of five feet each. Micromegas, inhabitant of the country of Sirius, is 24,000 paces tall, which is equivalent to 20,000 feet, and since we citizens of the earth are hardly five feet tall, and our sphere 9,000 leagues around; they will find, I say, that it is absolutely necessary that the sphere that produced him was 21,600,000 times greater in circumference than our little Earth.", "bn_01425478n": "Five days had the altar fires of the god of gods, Osiris, been left unburning. Even for one moment to allow darkness upon the altars of the god was considered by the priests to be a great offense against him. Per-haps within the approaching night a mighty earthquake would shake the city to the ground, or a fire from heaven would sweep upon them, a hideous plague strike them or some monster from the desert, where wild and terrible monsters were said to dwell, would rush upon them and Osiris himself would rise up, as he had done before, and swallow all Egypt in his wrath.", "bn_03297228n": "They had run him into the round-house after his trial\u2014he had said good-bye to his best friend in the shops, the overhead travelling-crane\u2014the big world was just outside; and the other locos were taking stock of him. He looked at the semicircle of bold, unwinking headlights, heard the low purr and mutter of the steam mounting in the gauges\u2014scornful hisses of contempt as a slack valve lifted a little\u2014and would have given a month's oil for leave to crawl through his own driving-wheels into the brick ash-pit beneath him.", "bn_03520895n": "It was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby Birch had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of Peck Valley Cemetery, escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means; but while this much was undoubtedly true, there were other and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium toward the last. He was merely crass of fibre and function\u2014thoughtless, careless, and liquorish, as his easily avoidable accident proves, and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste.", "bn_00173084n": "So the woman said to her eldest daughter, \"You must just go out and see if you can find our hen, for have it back we must, even if we have to fetch it out of the hill.\" Well! So the woman said to her eldest daughter, \"You must just go out and see if you can find our hen, for have it back we must, even if we have to fetch it out of the hill.\" Well!", "bn_00663751n": "They are, succinctly, these: My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and about nine months ago, it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission: no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how long a period, the effusions of Death might be arrested by the process.", "bn_03441968n": "But the true epicure in the terrible, to whom a new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and justification of existence, esteems most of all the ancient, desolate farmhouses of backwoods New England; for there the dark elements of strength, solitude, grotesqueness and ignorance combine to form the perfection of the hideous. Most horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses remote from travelled ways, usually squatted upon some grassy slope or leaning against some gigantic outcropping of rock.", "bn_03520917n": "I had delved not a little into odd Eastern lore when overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in America\u2019s vast West\u2014a life wherein I found it well to accept a name\u2014my present one\u2014which is very common and carries no meaning. In the summer and autumn of 1894 I dwelt in the drear expanses of the Cactus Mountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated Norton Mine, whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething cauldron of sordid life.", "bn_00955099n": "I should have known that the Arabs had good reason for shunning the nameless city, the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living man, yet I defied them and went into the untrodden waste with my camel. I alone have seen it, and that is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as mine; why no other man shivers so horribly when the night wind rattles the windows.", "bn_03396420n": "\"I myself have experienced neither capital punishment nor life-imprisonment, but if one may judge a priori, then in my opinion capital punishment is more moral and more humane than imprisonment. Who is the more humane executioner, one who kills you in a few seconds or one who draws the life out of you incessantly, for years?\" \"They're both equally immoral,\" remarked one of the guests, \"because their purpose is the same, to take away life. I bet you two millions you wouldn't stick in a cell even for five years.\" \"If that's serious,\" replied the lawyer, \"then I bet I'll stay not five but fifteen.\" \"Fifteen!", "bn_03079213n": "My wealth is in little memories and dreams, and in hopes that I sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs the lotus-buds.\" When the men of Teloth heard these things they whispered to one another; for though in the granite city there is no laughter or song, the stern men sometimes look to the Karthian hills in the spring and think of the barrens of distant Oonai whereof travellers have told. And if thou and I were to speak in the city, \"and I dreamed in the city pools, and I saw in the city courtyards, and the sweetness of flowers borne on the south wind that made the trees sing. And too, I remember the sun of morning bright above the many-coloured hills in summer, and the sweetness of flowers borne on the south wind that made the trees sing.", "bn_01304399n": "I have, on the contrary, delved deeply into all the antiquities of the place, and have personally explored every region, of whatever name, which could possibly answer to the street I knew as the Rue d'Auseil. But despite all I have done, it remains an humiliating fact that I cannot find the house, the street, or even the locality, where, during the last months of my impoverished life as a student of metaphysics at the university, I heard the music of Erich Zann.", "bn_03520887n": "I was shown into the attic chamber by a grave, intelligent-looking man with his quiet clothes and an iron-gray beard, who spoke to me in this fashion: \"Yes, he lived here\u2014but I don\u2019t advise your doing anything. We even avoid looking at it very steadily.\" After a time the man left me alone in the attic room. I seemed to know what to do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light\u2014or what looked like one\u2014out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes.", "bn_00210737n": "When he was no more than six he used to go out with the girls to watch the cows and sheep in the pasture, and a little later he looked after the horses by day and by night. When his father scolded him he would stand mute and listen attentively, and as soon as the scolding was over would smile and go on with his work. He was given his brother's old boots, his father's old coat and cap, and was taken to town. It consisted of the merchant's wife: her old mother: a married son poorly educated who was in his father's business: another son, a learned one who had finished school and entered the University.", "bn_17385267n": "He looked at every one of them, and lifting all the lids, applied his nose to each, and said at last, \"The jelly seems pretty good; you may weigh me out four half ounces, or I don't mind having a quarter of a pound.\" The woman, who had expected to find a good customer, gave him what he asked for, but went off angry and grumbling.
