5: Who wouldn't, knowing everyone on Earth was dead except Pa and Ma and Sis and you?
17: Let me tell you about the Nest.
18: It's low and snug, just room for the four of us and our things.
25: The fourth wall has blankets all over except around the fireplace, in which there is a fire that must never go out.
26: It keeps us from freezing and does a lot more besides.
30: It's Pa who is the chief guardian of the fire, though.
42: Yet it's that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive.
43: It slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the fire.
50: You see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe.
99: We know that everything is dead out there.
100: Pa heard the last radio voices fade away years ago, and had seen some of the last folks die who weren't as lucky or well-protected as us.
147: He told us how the Earth had been swinging around the Sun ever so steady and warm, and the people on it fixing to make money and wars and have a good time and get power and treat each other right or wrong, when without warning there comes charging out of space this dead star, this burned out sun, and upsets everything.
157: The dark star, as Pa went on telling it, rushed in pretty fast and there wasn't much time to get ready.
160: First off they thought it would hit the Sun, and then they thought it would hit the Earth.
161: There was even the start of a rush to get to a place called China, because people thought the star would hit on the other side.
162: But then they found it wasn't going to hit either side, but was going to come very close to the Earth.
177: You see, Pa and some scientist friends of his had figured out part of what was going to happen--they'd known we'd get captured and our air would freeze--and they'd been working like mad to fix up a place with airtight walls and doors, and insulation against the cold, and big supplies of food and fuel and water and bottled air.
178: But the place got smashed in the last earthquakes and all Pa's friends were killed then and in the Big Jerk.
179: So he had to start over and throw the Nest together quick without any advantages, just using any stuff he could lay his hands on.
237: In through the blanket stepped the beautiful young lady.
239: And two other faces peered over her shoulders--men's faces, white and staring.
245: These three people had survived, and quite a few others with them.
247: They were from Los Alamos and they were getting their heat and power from atomic energy.
262: No good trying long-distance radio signals, of course, since there was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth.
263: Well, they'd found other colonies at Argonne and Brookhaven and way around the world at Harwell and Tanna Tuva.
289: Or maybe we will join the pioneers who are going to try to establish a new colony at the uranium mines at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo.
