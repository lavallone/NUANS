0: On a verdant slope of Mount Maenalus, in Arcadia, there stands an olive grove about the ruins of a villa.
1: Close by is a tomb, once beautiful with the sublimest sculptures, but now fallen into as great decay as the house.
2: At one end of that tomb, its curious roots displacing the time-stained blocks of Pentelic marble, grows an unnaturally large olive tree of oddly repellent shape; so like to some grotesque man, or death-distorted body of a man, that the country folk fear to pass it at night when the moon shines faintly through the crooked boughs.
3: Mount Maenalus is a chosen haunt of dreaded Pan, whose queer companions are many, and simple swains believe that the tree must have some hideous kinship to these weird Panisci; but an old bee-keeper who lives in the neighboring cottage told me a different story.
4: Many years ago, when the hillside villa was new and resplendent, there dwelt within it the two sculptors Kalos and Musides.
7: All men paid homage to Kalos and Musides, and marvelled that no shadow of artistic jealousy cooled the warmth of their brotherly friendship.
8: But though Kalos and Musides dwelt in unbroken harmony, their natures were not alike.
9: Whilst Musides revelled by night amidst the urban gaieties of Tegea, Kalos would remain at home; stealing away from the sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove.
10: There he would meditate upon the visions that filled his mind, and there devise the forms of beauty which later became immortal in breathing marble.
12: So famous were Kalos and Musides, that none wondered when the Tyrant of Syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of Tyche which he had planned for his city.
13: Of great size and cunning workmanship must the statue be, for it was to form a wonder of nations and a goal of travellers.
14: Exalted beyond thought would be he whose work should gain acceptance, and for this honor Kalos and Musides were invited to compete.
15: Their brotherly love was well known, and the crafty Tyrant surmised that each, instead of concealing his work from the other, would offer aid and advice; this charity producing two images of unheard of beauty, the lovelier of which would eclipse even the dreams of poets.
16: With joy the sculptors hailed the Tyrant's offer, so that in the days that followed their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels.
19: At night, as of yore, Musides sought the banquet halls of Tegea whilst Kalos wandered alone in the olive Grove.
20: But as time passed, men observed a want of gaiety in the once sparkling Musides.
23: Then one day Musides spoke of the illness of Kalos, after which none marvelled again at his sadness, since the sculptors' attachment was known to be deep and sacred.
24: Subsequently many went to visit Kalos, and indeed noticed the pallor of his face; but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of Musides who was clearly distracted with anxiety and who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own hands.
26: As Kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend, he desired to be carried often to the grove which he so loved.
29: At last the end drew near, and Kalos discoursed of things beyond this life.
30: Musides, weeping, promised him a sepulchre more lovely than the tomb of Mausolus; but Kalos bade him speak no more of marble glories.
31: Only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man; that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his resting place-close to his head.
32: And one night, sitting alone in the darkness of the olive grove, Kalos died.
33: Beautiful beyond words was the marble sepulchre which stricken Musides carved for his beloved friend.
34: None but Kalos himself could have fashioned such basreliefs, wherein were displayed all the splendours of Elysium.
35: Nor did Musides fail to bury close to Kalos' head the olive twigs from the grove.
39: Meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend, where a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleeper's head.
42: Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to the Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty statue was finished.
43: By this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions, exceeding all other trees of its kind, and sending out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which Musides labored.
47: The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant's emissaries came to Tegea.
49: As the night wore on a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of Maenalus, and the men from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town.
54: In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant's messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done strange things.
55: Slaves' cries ascended from a scene of desolation, and no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein Musides had dreamed and toiled.
56: Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peri-style had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins.
57: Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos.
58: And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment, for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of Tyche, no trace could be discovered.
61: But the olive grove still stands, as does the tree growing out of the tomb of Kalos, and the old bee-keeper told me that sometimes the boughs whisper to one another in the night wind, saying over and over again.
