0: Claude Gueux was a poor workman, living in Paris about eight years ago, with his mistress and child.
1: Although his education had been neglected, and he could not even read, the man was naturally clever and intelligent, and thought deeply over matters.
3: The man, the woman, and the child were frozen and famished.
4: The man turned thief.
6: What signifies, as the result was the same: to the woman and child it gave three days' bread and warmth; to the man, five years' imprisonment.
7: He was taken to Clairvaux,—the abbey now converted into a prison, its cells into dungeons, and the altar itself into a pillory.
12: Over the prison workshop was an inspector, who rarely forgot that he was a jailer also to his subordinates, handing them the tools with one hand, and casting chains upon them with the other.
13: A tyrant, never using even self-reasoning; with ideas against which there was no appeal; hard rather than firm, at times he could even be jocular,—doubtless a good father, a good husband, really not vicious, but , bad.
21: After a time Claude had accustomed himself to prison rule, and by his calmness of manner and a certain amount of resolution clearly marked in his face, he had acquired a great ascendancy over his companions, who so much admired him that they asked his advice, and tried in all ways to imitate him.
25: To him two men's rations would have been scarcely sufficient.
28: He had just finished his meagre fare, and was about to resume his labours, hoping in work to forget famine, when a weakly-looking young man came towards him, holding a knife and his untasted rations in his hand, but seemingly afraid to address him.
33: For a moment Claude was taken aback, but without further ceremony he divided the food in two and at once partook of one half.
34: "Thank you," said the young man; "allow me to share my rations with you every day."
35: "What is your name?" said Claude.
36: "Albin."
42: The feeling was more like that of father and son than one brother to another; everything created a bond of union between them,—the very toil they endured together, the fact of sleeping in the same quarters and taking exercise in the same courtyard.
44: The inspector of the workshop was so hated by the prisoners that he often had recourse to Claude Gueux to enforce his authority; and when a tumult was on the point of breaking out, a few words from Claude had more effect than the authority of the warders.
45: Although the inspector was glad to avail himself of this influence, he was jealous all the same, and hated the superior prisoner with an envious and implacable feeling,—an example of might over right, all the more fearful as it was secretly nourished.
47: One morning as th warders were going their rounds one of them summoned Albin, who was working with Claude, to go before the inspector.
58: On the following night the inspector, Monsieur D____, went his rounds as usual.
60: "Sir," said Claude, as the inspector was about to pass him, "has Albin really been quartered elsewhere?"
64: Could you not manage to let him resume his old place near me?"
65: "Impossible; the order cannot be revoked."
72: "Why, then," cried Claude, "separate me from Albin?"
73: "Because I do," replied the inspector, and with that he passed on.
75: Many offered to share their rations with him, but he steadily refused, and continued his usual routine in silence,—breaking it only to ask the inspector daily, in tones of anguish mingled with rage, something between a prayer and a threat, these two words: "And Albin?"
76: The inspector simply passed on, shrugging his shoulders; but had he only observed Claude he would have seen the evident change, noticable to all present, and he would have heard these words, spoken respectfully but firmly:—- "Sir, listen to me; send my companion to me.
92: Claude daily impressed the fact on the inspector how much Albin's absence affected him, but with no result save four-and-twenty hours' solitary confinement.
93: On the 4th of November he looked round his cell for the little that remained to remind him of his former life.
98: Shortly before noon he made some excuse to go down into the carpenter's quarters, a story below his own, at the time the warders were absent.
100: "Can any one lend me an axe?" he said.
101: "What for?"
102: Without exacting any promises of secrecy he at once replied: "To kill the inspector with tonight."
109: At seven o'clock the prisoners were locked in their several workshops.
133: Amidst the most profound silence the clock struck nine; the door was thrown open, and the inspector came in as usual alone, looking quite jovial and self-satisfied, passing rapidly along, tossing his head at one, grinding words out to another, little heeding the eyes fixed so fiercely upon him.
134: Just then he heard Claude's step, and turning quickly round said, — "What are you doing here?
135: Why are you not in your place?" just as he would have spoken to a dog.
151: Sir, my good sir, I implore you, in the name of Heaven, to grant my prayer!"
157: Why did you separate us?"
158: "I have already answered you: because I chose," replied the inspector.
159: With that he was about to lift the latch, when Claude raised the axe, and without one cry the inspector fell to the ground, with his skull completely cloven from three heavy blows dealt with the rapidity of lightning.
161: Claude, throwing the axe aside, cried out, "Now for the other!"
162: The other was himself; and taking the scissors, his wife's, he plunged them into his breast.
163: But the blade was short, and the chest was deep, and vainly he strove to give the fatal blow.
166: When Claude regained consciousness he was in bed, surrounded by every care and covered with bandages.
169: Then the interrogatory commenced.
170: "Did you kill the inspector of the prison workshops at Clairvaux?"
171: "Yes," was the reply.
172: "Why did you do so?"
173: "Because I did."
174: Claude's wounds now assumed a more serious aspect, and he was prostrated with a fever which threatened his life.
176: On the 16th of March, 1832, perfectly cured, Claude appeared in court at Troyes, to answer the charge brought against him.
187: After the long address by the prosecution, Claude's counsel rose.
189: Claude in his turn gave evidence, and every one was astonished at his intelligence; there appeared far more of the orator about this poor workman than the assassin.
193: Once Claude lost his temper, when the counsel for the prosecution stated that he had assassinated the inspector without provocation.
207: The judge then summed up the case in a clear and impartial manner,—dwelling on the life Claude had led, living openly with an improper character; then he had robbed, and ended by being a murderer.
213: The jury retired for a quarter of an hour, and according to the judgment of these twelve countrymen—gentlemen of the jury, as they are styled—Claude Gueux was condemned to death.
219: He refused to make any appeal until the last minute, but at the instance of one of the sisters who had nursed him he consented to do so.
220: She in her fulness of heart gave him a five-franc piece.
221: His fellow prisoners, as we have already noticed, were devoted to him, and placed all the means at their disposal to help him to escape.
223: He gave them all up to the warder.
224: On the 8th of June, 1832, seven months and four days after the murder, the recorder of the court came, and Claude was told that he had but one hour more to live, for his appeal had been rejected.
226: First came the priest, then the executioner.
236: He wished to embrace the priest and the executioner, thanking the one and pardoning the other; the executioner simply repulsed him.
237: Just before he was bound to the infernal machine, he gave the five franc piece to the priest, saying, "For the poor."
238: The hour had scarcely struck its eight chimes, when this man, so noble, so intelligent, received the fatal blow which severed his head from his body.
242: We have given the history of Claude Gueux's life, more to solve a difficult problem than for aught else.
244: What was his training, and what was the penalty?
245: This must interest society generally; for this man was well gifted, his instincts were good.
251: Society placed him in a prison where the evil was yet greater, and he ended up becoming a murderer.
252: Can we really blame him, or ourselves?—questions which require deep thought, or the result will be that we shall be compelled to shirk this most important subject.
253: The facts are now before us, and if the government gives no thought to the matter, what are the rulers about?
