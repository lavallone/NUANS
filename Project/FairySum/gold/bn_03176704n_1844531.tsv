0: One dollar and eighty-seven cents.
1: That was all.
4: Three times Della counted it.
21: Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present.
36: Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.
43: It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her.
47: With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.
48: Where she stopped the sign read: “Mme.
49: Sofronie.
50: Hair Goods of All Kinds.”
53: “Will you buy my hair?” asked Della.
54: “I buy hair,” said Madame.
55: “Take yer hat off and let’s have a sight at the looks of it.”
56: Down rippled the brown cascade.
57: “Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.
58: “Give it to me quick,” said Della.
61: She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s present.
62: She found it at last.
65: It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do.
73: When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason.
76: Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy.
82: Jim was never late.
84: Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment.
86: The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it.
91: His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her.
95: “Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way.
96: I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn’t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present.
97: It’ll grow out again—you won’t mind, will you?
98: I just had to do it.
99: My hair grows awfully fast.
120: Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.
123: But if you’ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.
127: For there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window.
130: And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.
133: Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present.
134: She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm.
136: “Isn’t it a dandy, Jim?
137: I hunted all over town to find it.
138: You’ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now.
139: Give me your watch.
140: I want to see how it looks on it.”
144: I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs.
145: And now suppose you put the chops on.”
146: The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger.
147: They invented the art of giving Christmas presents.
148: Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication.
150: But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest.
