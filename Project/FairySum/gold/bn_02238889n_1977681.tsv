2: The emperor's palace was the most beautiful thing in the world; it was made entirely of the finest porcelain, very costly, but at the same time so fragile that it could only be touched with the very greatest care.
3: There were the most extraordinary flowers to be seen in the garden; the most beautiful ones had little silver bells tied to them, which tinkled perpetually, so that one should not pass the flowers without looking at them.
4: Every little detail in the garden had been most carefully thought out, and it was so big, that even the gardener himself did not know where it ended.
5: If one went on walking, one came to beautiful woods with lofty trees and deep lakes.
6: The wood extended to the sea, which was deep and blue, deep enough for large ships to sail up right under the branches of the trees.
7: Among these trees lived a nightingale, which sang so deliciously, that even the poor fisherman, who had plenty of other things to do, lay still to listen to it, when he was out at night drawing in his nets.
11: Travellers came to the emperor's capital, from every country in the world; they admired everything very much, especially the palace and the gardens, but when they heard the nightingale they all said, 'This is better than anything!'
12: When they got home they described it, and the learned ones wrote many books about the town, the palace and the garden; but nobody forgot the nightingale, it was always put above everything else.
13: Those among them who were poets wrote the most beautiful poems, all about the nightingale in the woods by the deep blue sea.
14: These books went all over the world, and in course of time some of them reached the emperor.
15: He sat in his golden chair reading and reading, and nodding his head, well pleased to hear such beautiful descriptions of the town, the palace and the garden.
16: '
17: But the nightingale is the best of all,' he read.
18: 'What is this?' said the emperor.
19: 'The nightingale?
20: Why, I know nothing about it.
27: 'I have never heard it mentioned,' said the gentleman-in-waiting.
28: 'It has never been presented at court.'
29: 'I wish it to appear here this evening to sing to me,' said the emperor.
41: There was much questioning about this nightingale, which was known to all the outside world, but to no one at court.
42: At last they found a poor little maid in the kitchen.
43: She said, 'Oh heavens, the nightingale?
44: I know it very well.
45: Yes, indeed it can sing.
49: 'Little kitchen-maid,' said the gentleman-in-waiting, 'I will procure you a permanent position in the kitchen, and permission to see the emperor dining, if you will take us to the nightingale.
50: It is commanded to appear at court to-night.'
51: Then they all went out into the wood where the nightingale usually sang.
64: 'There it is!' said the little girl.
66: and she pointed to a little grey bird up among the branches.
71: 'Little nightingale!' called the kitchen-maid quite loud, 'our gracious emperor wishes you to sing to him!'
72: 'With the greatest of pleasure!' said the nightingale, warbling away in the most delightful fashion.
76: I am sure it will be a great success at court!'
77: 'Shall I sing again to the emperor?' said the nightingale, who thought he was present.
78: 'My precious little nightingale,' said the gentleman-in-waiting, 'I have the honour to command your attendance at a court festival to-night, where you will charm his gracious majesty the emperor with your fascinating singing.'
79: 'It sounds best among the trees,' said the nightingale, but it went with them willingly when it heard that the emperor wished it.
87: The emperor was charmed, and said the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round its neck.
95: Yes, indeed, the nightingale had made a sensation.
96: It was to stay at court now, and to have its own cage, as well as liberty to walk out twice a day, and once in the night.
101: One day a large parcel came for the emperor; outside was written the word 'Nightingale.'
102: 'Here we have another new book about this celebrated bird,' said the emperor.
103: But it was no book it was a little work of art in a box, an artificial nightingale, exactly like the living one, but it was studded all over with diamonds, rubies and sapphires.
108: 'Now, they must sing together; what a duet that will be.'
109: Then they had to sing together, but they did not get on very well, for the real nightingale sang in its own way, and the artificial one could only sing waltzes.
111: Then the artificial bird had to sing alone.
112: It was just as great a success as the real one, and then it was so much prettier to look at; it glittered like bracelets and breast-pins.
113: It sang the same tune three and thirty times over, and yet it was not tired; people would willingly have heard it from the beginning again, but the emperor said that the real one must have a turn nowâ€”but where was it?
114: No one had noticed that it had flown out of the open window, back to its own green woods.
126: The real nightingale was banished from the kingdom.
127: The artificial bird had its place on a silken cushion, close to the emperor's bed: all the presents it had received of gold and precious jewels were scattered round it.
132: Things went on in this way for a whole year.
135: But one evening when the bird was singing its best, and the emperor was lying in bed listening to it, something gave way inside the bird with a 'whizz.'
136: Then a spring burst, 'whirr' went all the wheels, and the music stopped.
142: Five years now passed, and then a great grief came upon the nation, for they were all very fond of their emperor, and he was ill and could not live, it was said.
148: But the emperor was not dead yet.
149: He lay stiff and pale in the gorgeous bed with its velvet hangings and heavy golden tassels.
150: There was an open window high above him, and the moon streamed in upon the emperor, and the artificial bird beside him.
151: The poor emperor could hardly breathe, he seemed to have a weight on his chest, he opened his eyes, and then he saw that it was Death sitting upon his chest, wearing his golden crown.
165: Death continued to fix the great empty sockets of his eyes upon him, and all was silent, so terribly silent.
166: Suddenly, close to the window, there was a burst of lovely song; it was the living nightingale, perched on a branch outside.
167: It had heard of the emperor's need, and had come to bring comfort and hope to him.
168: As it sang the faces round became fainter and fainter, and the blood coursed with fresh vigour in the emperor's veins and through his feeble limbs.
169: Even Death himself listened to the song and said, 'Go on, little nightingale, go on!'
173: This song brought to Death a longing for his own garden, and, like a cold grey mist, he passed out of the window.
174: 'Thanks, thanks!' said the emperor; 'you heavenly little bird, I know you!
175: I banished you from my kingdom, and yet you have charmed the evil visions away from my bed by your song, and even Death away from my heart!
