0: Claude Gueux was a poor workman, living in Paris about eight years ago, with his mistress and child.
1: Although his education had been neglected, and he could not even read, the man was naturally clever and intelligent, and thought deeply over matters.
3: The man, the woman, and the child were frozen and famished.
4: The man turned thief.
6: What signifies, as the result was the same: to the woman and child it gave three days' bread and warmth; to the man, five years' imprisonment.
7: He was taken to Clairvaux,—the abbey now converted into a prison, its cells into dungeons, and the altar itself into a pillory.
12: Over the prison workshop was an inspector, who rarely forgot that he was a jailer also to his subordinates, handing them the tools with one hand, and casting chains upon them with the other.
15: This man's chief characteristic was obstinacy; and so proud was he of this very stubbornness that he compared himself with Napoleon,—an optical delusion, like taking the mere flicker of a candle for a star.
19: The inspector soon singled out Claude Gueux, who had been numbered and placed in the workshop, and finding him clever, treated him well.
21: After a time Claude had accustomed himself to prison rule, and by his calmness of manner and a certain amount of resolution clearly marked in his face, he had acquired a great ascendancy over his companions, who so much admired him that they asked his advice, and tried in all ways to imitate him.
24: Such popularity ever has as its attendant hatred; and though beloved by the prisoners, Claude was detested by the jailers.
25: To him two men's rations would have been scarcely sufficient.
27: When a free man, Claude Gueux could earn his daily four-pound loaf and enjoy it; but as a prisoner he daily worked, and for his labour received one pound and a half of bread and four ounces of meat; it naturally followed that he was always hungry.
28: He had just finished his meagre fare, and was about to resume his labours, hoping in work to forget famine, when a weakly-looking young man came towards him, holding a knife and his untasted rations in his hand, but seemingly afraid to address him.
29: "What do you want?" said Claude, roughly.
32: "Help me with my rations; I have more than I can eat."
33: For a moment Claude was taken aback, but without further ceremony he divided the food in two and at once partook of one half.
34: "Thank you," said the young man; "allow me to share my rations with you every day."
41: The same scene took place daily between this man old before his time (he was only thirty-six) and the boy of twenty, who looked at the most seventeen.
44: The inspector of the workshop was so hated by the prisoners that he often had recourse to Claude Gueux to enforce his authority; and when a tumult was on the point of breaking out, a few words from Claude had more effect than the authority of the warders.
45: Although the inspector was glad to avail himself of this influence, he was jealous all the same, and hated the superior prisoner with an envious and implacable feeling,—an example of might over right, all the more fearful as it was secretly nourished.
46: But Claude cared so much for Albin that he thought little about the inspector.
47: One morning as th warders were going their rounds one of them summoned Albin, who was working with Claude, to go before the inspector.
50: All day Claude looked in vain for his companion, and at night, finding him still absent, he broke though his ordinary reserve and addressed the turnkey.
54: "His quarters have been changed," was the reply.
55: For a moment Claude trembled, then calmly continued, "Who gave the order?"
56: "Monsieur D___."
57: This was the inspector's name.
58: On the following night the inspector, Monsieur D____, went his rounds as usual.
59: Claude, who had perceived him from the distance, rose, and hastened to rasie his woollen cap and button his gray woolelen vest to the throat,—considered a mark of respect to superiors in prison discipline.
68: "Monsieur D____," replied Claude, "on you my life depends."
69: "I never cancel an order once given."
70: "Sir, what have I done to you?"
71: "Nothing."
72: "Why, then," cried Claude, "separate me from Albin?"
73: "Because I do," replied the inspector, and with that he passed on.
74: Claude's head sank down, like the poor caged lion deprived of his dog; but the grief, though so deeply felt, in no way changed his appetite,—he was famished.
75: Many offered to share their rations with him, but he steadily refused, and continued his usual routine in silence,—breaking it only to ask the inspector daily, in tones of anguish mingled with rage, something between a prayer and a threat, these two words: "And Albin?"
97: During the day he worked with more than ordinary ardour, wishing to finish a straw hat, which he had been paid for in advance by a tradesman at Troyes,—M. Bressier.
98: Shortly before noon he made some excuse to go down into the carpenter's quarters, a story below his own, at the time the warders were absent.
99: Claude received a hearty welcome, as he was equally popular here as elsewhere.
100: "Can any one lend me an axe?" he said.
101: "What for?"
102: Without exacting any promises of secrecy he at once replied: "To kill the inspector with tonight."
104: Now, there were twenty-seven prisoners present, and not one of those men betrayed him; they even refrained from talking upon the subject among themselves, waiting for the terrible event which must follow.
132: As the clock sounded the last quarter to nine, Claude rose and placed himself near the entrance, apparently calm.
133: Amidst the most profound silence the clock struck nine; the door was thrown open, and the inspector came in as usual alone, looking quite jovial and self-satisfied, passing rapidly along, tossing his head at one, grinding words out to another, little heeding the eyes fixed so fiercely upon him.
136: Claude answered respectfully, "I wish to speak to you, sir."
137: "On what subject?" "Albin."
138: "Again!"
141: Claude, following him closely, replied: "Sir, return my companion to me!"
142: "Impossible!"
151: Sir, my good sir, I implore you, in the name of Heaven, to grant my prayer!"
152: Claude, overcome with emotion, waited for an answer.
153: "Impossible!" replied the inspector impatiently; "I will not recall my words.
154: Now go, you annoyance!"
157: Why did you separate us?"
158: "I have already answered you: because I chose," replied the inspector.
159: With that he was about to lift the latch, when Claude raised the axe, and without one cry the inspector fell to the ground, with his skull completely cloven from three heavy blows dealt with the rapidity of lightning.
160: A fourth completely disfigured his face, and Claude, in his mad fury, gave another and a useless blow ; for the inspector was dead.
161: Claude, throwing the axe aside, cried out, "Now for the other!"
162: The other was himself; and taking the scissors, his wife's, he plunged them into his breast.
163: But the blade was short, and the chest was deep, and vainly he strove to give the fatal blow.
164: At last, covered with blood he fell fainting across the dead.
166: When Claude regained consciousness he was in bed, surrounded by every care and covered with bandages.
167: Near him were Sisters of Charity, and a recorder ready to take down his deposition, who with much interest inquired how he was.
169: Then the interrogatory commenced.
170: "Did you kill the inspector of the prison workshops at Clairvaux?"
171: "Yes," was the reply.
172: "Why did you do so?"
173: "Because I did."
174: Claude's wounds now assumed a more serious aspect, and he was prostrated with a fever which threatened his life.
176: On the 16th of March, 1832, perfectly cured, Claude appeared in court at Troyes, to answer the charge brought against him.
178: The court was well guarded by a strong military guard, to keep the witnesses within bounds, as they were all convicts.
189: Claude in his turn gave evidence, and every one was astonished at his intelligence; there appeared far more of the orator about this poor workman than the assassin.
190: In a clear and straightforward way he detailed the facts as they were, — standing proudly there, resolved to tell the whole truth.
191: At times the crowd was carried away by his eloquence.
192: This man, who could not read, would grasp the most difficult points of argument, yet treat the judges with all due deference.
193: Once Claude lost his temper, when the counsel for the prosecution stated that he had assassinated the inspector without provocation.
194: "What!" said Claude, "I had no provocation?
196: A drunkard strikes me, — I kill him; then you would allow there was provocation, and the penalty of death would be changed for that of the galleys.
197: But a man who wounds me in every way during four years, humiliates me for four years, taunts me daily, hourly, for four years, and heaps every insult on my head,—what follows?
198: You consider I have had no provocation!
207: The judge then summed up the case in a clear and impartial manner,—dwelling on the life Claude had led, living openly with an improper character; then he had robbed, and ended by being a murderer.
208: All this was true.
213: The jury retired for a quarter of an hour, and according to the judgment of these twelve countrymen—gentlemen of the jury, as they are styled—Claude Gueux was condemned to death.
219: He refused to make any appeal until the last minute, but at the instance of one of the sisters who had nursed him he consented to do so.
220: She in her fulness of heart gave him a five-franc piece.
221: His fellow prisoners, as we have already noticed, were devoted to him, and placed all the means at their disposal to help him to escape.
223: He gave them all up to the warder.
224: On the 8th of June, 1832, seven months and four days after the murder, the recorder of the court came, and Claude was told that he had but one hour more to live, for his appeal had been rejected.
226: First came the priest, then the executioner.
227: he was humble to the priest, and listened to him with great attention, regretting much that he had not had the benefit of religious training, at the same time blaming himself for much in the past.
228: He was courteous in his manner to the executioner; in fact he gave up all,—his soul to the priest, his body to the executioner.
233: The only trifle he retained was the five franc piece that the sister had given him, which he kept in his right hand after he was bound.
237: Just before he was bound to the infernal machine, he gave the five franc piece to the priest, saying, "For the poor."
238: The hour had scarcely struck its eight chimes, when this man, so noble, so intelligent, received the fatal blow which severed his head from his body.
242: We have given the history of Claude Gueux's life, more to solve a difficult problem than for aught else.
243: In his life there are two questions to be considered,—before his fall, and after his fall.
244: What was his training, and what was the penalty?
245: This must interest society generally; for this man was well gifted, his instincts were good.
250: An intelligent and most noble-hearted man, placed in the midst of evil surroundings, he turned thief.
251: Society placed him in a prison where the evil was yet greater, and he ended up becoming a murderer.
252: Can we really blame him, or ourselves?—questions which require deep thought, or the result will be that we shall be compelled to shirk this most important subject.
253: The facts are now before us, and if the government gives no thought to the matter, what are the rulers about?
256: I wish to cast no reflections on the patrol, who keep order and protect our homes, but on the absurdity of making such parade and military hubub about turning citizens into parodies of soldiers.
257: Deputies or ministers!
258: it is important that we should sound every subject, even though it end in nothing; that we should question and cross-question what we know but little about.
259: Rulers and legislators!
261: You assert that it is the habits of modern civilization that have engendered adultery, incest, parricide, infanticide, and poisoning,—proving that you know little of Jocasta, Phedra, Oedipus, Medea, or Rodoguna.
263: Very important indeed all this is, but we consider there are subjects of far greater consequence.
273: Whether a republic or a monarchy, the fact remains the same,—the people suffer!
274: The people are famished, the people are frozen.
275: Such misery leads them to crime: the galleys take the sons, houses of ill-fame the daughters.
279: You are at fault; now study the matter more deeply.
284: The convict prison is a blister which spreads far worse matter than ever it extracts; and as for the sentence of death, when carried out it is a barbarous amputation.
285: Therefore, branding, penal servitude, and sentence of death are all of one class; you have done away with the branding, banish the rest.
289: Revise your laws; revise your codes; rebuild your prisons; replace your judges.
290: Make laws suited to the present time.
292: Suppress the executioner; you could defray the expenses of six hundred schoolmasters with the wages you give your eighty executioners.
293: Think of the multitude; then there would be schools for the children, workshops for the men.
295: Fancy, Switzerland can read, Belgium can read, Denmark can read, Greece can read, Ireland can read — and France cannot read!
299: Nature was first to blame, no doubt; but the want of training fostered the evil.
300: Then give the people a fair education, and what there is of good in these ill-conditioned minds, let that be developed.
301: people must be judged by their opportunities.
304: Ignorance is preferable to a little ill-directed knowledge; and remember, there is a book of far greater importance than the 'Compere Mathieu,' more popular than the 'Constitutionnel,' and more worthy of perusal than the charter of 1830,—that is the Bible.
308: "In the midst of all this wretchedness, if you but throw hope in the balance, let the poor man learn there is a heaven where joy reigns, a paradise that he can share, and you raise him; he feels that he has a part in the rich man's joys.
309: And this was the teaching Jesus gave, and He knew more about it than Voltaire.
314: "Then give the people all encouragement; improve the masses, enlighten them, guard their morals, make them useful, and to such heads as those you will not require to use cold steel."
