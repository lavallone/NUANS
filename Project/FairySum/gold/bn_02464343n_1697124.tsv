0: Horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend, Crawford Tillinghast.
1: I had not seen him since that day, two months and a half before, when he told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage.
2: I had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine, eating little and excluding even the servants, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature.
3: It is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or grayed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing, the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and twitching.
5: But such was the aspect of Crawford Tilllinghast on the night his half coherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile; such was the specter that trembled as it admitted me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient, lonely house set back from Benevolent Street.
8: Tillinghast had once been the prey of failure, solitary and melancholy; but now I knew, with nauseating fears of my own, that he was the prey of success.
9: I had indeed warned him ten weeks before, when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover.
11: "What do we know," he had said, "of the world and the universe about us?
14: With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have.
15: I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows, and now I believe I have found a way to break down the barriers.
17: Within twenty-four hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized sense organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges.
18: Those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life.
21: We shall overleap time, space, and dimensions, and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation."
22: When Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated, for I knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused; but he was a fanatic, and drove me from the house.
23: Now he was no less a fanatic, but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment, and he had written me imperatively in a hand I could scarcely recognize.
24: As I entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle, I became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows.
26: I wished the servants were about, and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously.
30: Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could only guess, but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart, I could not doubt.
32: Up through the dark emptiness of the house I followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody of man.
37: We entered the laboratory in the attic, and I observed that detestable electrical machine, glowing with a sickly, sinister violet luminosity.
40: He now seated me near the machine, so that it was on my right, and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs.
41: The usual sputtering began, turned to a whine, and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence.
43: Tillinghast had been watching me, and noted my puzzled expression.
48: "Listen to me!
49: The waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity.
54: "Your existing sense-organs�ears first, I think�will pick up many of the impressions, for they are closely connected with the dormant organs.
56: You have heard of the pineal gland?
58: That gland is the great sense organ of organs�I have found out.
59: It is like sight in the end, and transmits visual pictures to the brain.
60: If you are normal, that is the way you ought to get most of it...
61: I mean get most of the evidence from beyond."
64: During the interval that Tillinghast was long silent I fancied myself in some vast incredible temple of long-dead gods; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision.
65: The picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite, sightless, soundless space.
66: There seemed to be a void, and nothing more, and I felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver I carried after dark since the night I was held up in East Providence.
72: I began to speak to Tillinghast, and as I did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished.
75: I whispered what I had experienced and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as possible.
76: "Don't move," he cautioned, "for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to see.
77: I told you the servants left, but I didn't tell you how.
78: It was that thick-witted house-keeper�she turned on the lights downstairs after I had warned her not to, and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations.
79: It must have been frightful�I could hear the screams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from another direction, and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house.
81: It got them all.
82: But so long as we don't move we're fairly safe.
84: Keep still!"
85: The combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis, and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what Tillinghast called "beyond."
87: I saw the blurred outlines of the room, but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognizable shapes or clouds, penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me.
92: At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body, and thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually.
94: Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight.
97: I saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar objects not one particle was vacant.
98: Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien, unknown entities.
100: Foremost among the living objects were inky, jellyfish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine.
104: Shudderingly I felt that I knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants, and could not exclude the thing from my mind as I strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us.
105: But Tillinghast had been watching me and was speaking.
106: "You see them?
110: Have I not succeeded in breaking down the barrier; have I not shown you worlds that no other living men have seen?"
111: I heard his scream through the horrible chaos, and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine.
114: "You think those floundering things wiped out the servants?
115: Fool, they are harmless!
117: You tried to stop me; you discouraged me when I needed every drop of encouragement I could get; you were afraid of the cosmic truth, you damned coward, but now I've got you!
118: What swept up the servants?
120: Don't know, eh!
121: You'll know soon enough.
125: I have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down demons from the stars...
128: Things are hunting me now�the things that devour and dissolve�but I know how to elude them.
129: It is you they will get, as they got the servants...
131: I told you it was dangerous to move, I have saved you so far by telling you to keep still�saved you to see more sights and to listen to me.
133: Don't worry, they won't hurt you.
134: They didn't hurt the servants�it was the seeing that made the poor devils scream so.
135: My pets are not pretty, for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are�very different.
136: Disintegration is quite painless, I assure you -- but I want you to see them.
138: You are curious?
144: Well, don't worry, my friend, for they are coming...
145: Look, look, curse you, look...
146: it's just over your left shoulder..."
147: What remains to be told is very brief, and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts.
148: The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast house and found us there�Tillinghast dead and me unconscious.
149: They arrested me because the revolver was in my hand, but released me in three hours, after they found it was apoplexy which had finished Tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor.
150: I did not tell very much of what I had seen, for I feared the coroner would be skeptical; but from the evasive outline I did give, the doctor told me that I had undoubtedly been hypnotized by the vindictive and homicidal madman.
154: What prevents me from believing the doctor is one simple fact�that the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say Crawford Tillinghast murdered.
