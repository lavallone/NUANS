0: IN China, as you know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all the people around him are Chinamen too.
2: The emperor's palace was the most beautiful thing in the world; it was made entirely of the finest porcelain, very costly, but at the same time so fragile that it could only be touched with the very greatest care.
5: If one went on walking, one came to beautiful woods with lofty trees and deep lakes.
7: Among these trees lived a nightingale, which sang so deliciously, that even the poor fisherman, who had plenty of other things to do, lay still to listen to it, when he was out at night drawing in his nets.
11: Travellers came to the emperor's capital, from every country in the world; they admired everything very much, especially the palace and the gardens, but when they heard the nightingale they all said, 'This is better than anything!'
29: 'I wish it to appear here this evening to sing to me,' said the emperor.
41: There was much questioning about this nightingale, which was known to all the outside world, but to no one at court.
42: At last they found a poor little maid in the kitchen.
49: 'Little kitchen-maid,' said the gentleman-in-waiting, 'I will procure you a permanent position in the kitchen, and permission to see the emperor dining, if you will take us to the nightingale.
51: Then they all went out into the wood where the nightingale usually sang.
71: 'Little nightingale!' called the kitchen-maid quite loud, 'our gracious emperor wishes you to sing to him!'
72: 'With the greatest of pleasure!' said the nightingale, warbling away in the most delightful fashion.
86: The nightingale sang delightfully, and the tears came into the emperor's eyes, nay, they rolled down his cheeks; and then the nightingale sang more beautifully than ever, its notes touched all hearts.
96: It was to stay at court now, and to have its own cage, as well as liberty to walk out twice a day, and once in the night.
101: One day a large parcel came for the emperor; outside was written the word 'Nightingale.'
102: 'Here we have another new book about this celebrated bird,' said the emperor.
103: But it was no book it was a little work of art in a box, an artificial nightingale, exactly like the living one, but it was studded all over with diamonds, rubies and sapphires.
113: It sang the same tune three and thirty times over, and yet it was not tired; people would willingly have heard it from the beginning again, but the emperor said that the real one must have a turn nowâ€”but where was it?
114: No one had noticed that it had flown out of the open window, back to its own green woods.
135: But one evening when the bird was singing its best, and the emperor was lying in bed listening to it, something gave way inside the bird with a 'whizz.'
136: Then a spring burst, 'whirr' went all the wheels, and the music stopped.
142: Five years now passed, and then a great grief came upon the nation, for they were all very fond of their emperor, and he was ill and could not live, it was said.
166: Suddenly, close to the window, there was a burst of lovely song; it was the living nightingale, perched on a branch outside.
167: It had heard of the emperor's need, and had come to bring comfort and hope to him.
173: This song brought to Death a longing for his own garden, and, like a cold grey mist, he passed out of the window.
