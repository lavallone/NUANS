1: On one of the planets that orbits the star named Sirius there lived a spirited young man, who I had the honor of meeting on the last voyage he made to our little ant hill.
2: He was called Micromegas, a fitting name for anyone so great.
3: He was eight leagues tall, or 24,000 geometric paces of five feet each.
10: As for his mind, it is one of the most cultivated that we have.
15: Towards his 450th year, near the end of his infancy, he dissected many small insects no more than 100 feet in diameter, which would evade ordinary microscopes.
16: He wrote a very curious book about this, and it gave him some income.
17: The mufti of his country, an extremely ignorant worrywart, found some suspicious, rash, disagreeable, and heretical propositions in the book, smelled heresy, and pursued it vigorously; it was a matter of finding out whether the substantial form of the fleas of Sirius were of the same nature as those of the snails.
19: Finally the mufti had the book condemned by jurisconsults who had not read it, and the author was ordered not to appear in court for 800 years.
21: He wrote an amusing song at the expense of the mufti, which the latter hardly noticed; and he took to voyaging from planet to planet in order to develop his heart and mind, as the saying goes.
28: Micromegas, after having toured around, arrived at the planet Saturn.
34: He built a strong friendship with the secretary of the academy of Saturn, a spirited man who had not invented anything, to tell the truth, but who understood the inventions of others very well, and who wrote some passable verses and carried out some complicated calculations.
93: Finally, after having told each other a little of what they knew and a lot of what they did not know, after having reasoned over the course of a revolution around the sun, they resolved to go on a small philosophical voyage together.
105: Our two explorers left all the same; they alighted first on the ring, which they found to be fairly flat, as conjectured by an illustrious inhabitant of our little sphere; from there they went easily from moon to moon.
107: When they had traveled about one hundred fifty million leagues, they met with the satellites of Jupiter.
118: Finally they perceived a small candle, it was earth; this was a pitiful sight to those who had just left Jupiter.
120: Carried by the tail of a comet, and finding an aurora borealis at the ready, they started towards it, and arrived at Earth on the northern coast of the Baltic sea, July 5, 1737, new style.
123: After resting for some time they ate two mountains for lunch, which their crew fixed up pretty nicely.
124: Then they decided to get to know the small country they were in.
132: The dwarf never got in over his knees, and the other hardly wet his heels.
135: The dwarf, who was a bit hasty sometimes, decided straightaway that the planet was uninhabited.
136: His first reason was that he had not seen anyone.
137: Micromegas politely indicated that this logic was rather flawed: "For," said he, "you do not see with your little eyes certain stars of the 50th magnitude that I can perceive very distinctly.
138: Do you conclude that these stars do not exist?"
153: The dispute might never have finished if it were not for Micromegas who, getting worked up, had the good luck to break the thread of his diamond necklace.
154: The diamonds fell; they were pretty little carats of fairly irregular size, of which the largest weighed four hundred pounds and the smallest fifty.
155: The dwarf recaptured some of them; bending down for a better look, he perceived that these diamonds were cut with the help of an excellent microscope.
156: So he took out a small microscope of 160 feet in diameter and put it up to his eye; and Micromegas took up one of 2,005 feet in diameter.
158: Finally the Saturnian saw something elusive that moved in the shallow waters of the Baltic sea; it was a whale.
160: The Saturnian, persuaded that our world was inhabited, figured very quickly that it was inhabited only by whales; and as he was very good at reasoning, he was determined to infer the origin and evolution of such a small atom; whether it had ideas, a will, liberty.
163: The two voyagers were therefore inclined to believe that there is no spirit in our home, when with the help of the microscope they perceived something as large as a whale floating on the Baltic Sea.
168: Micromegas slowly reached his hand towards the place where the object had appeared, extended two fingers, and withdrew them for fear of being mistaken, then opened and closed them, and skillfully seized the vessel that carried these fellows, putting it on his fingernail without pressing it too hard for fear of crushing it.
173: They made so much fuss that he finally felt something move, tickling his fingers.
174: It was a steel-tipped baton being pressed into his index finger.
184: What pleasure Micromegas felt at seeing these little machines move, at examining all their scurrying, at following them in their enterprises!
195: Micromegas, a much better observer than his dwarf, clearly saw that the atoms were speaking to each other, and pointed this out to his companion, who, ashamed of being mistaken about them reproducing, did not want to believe that such a species could communicate.
208: "That is very well said," echoed Micromegas, and he briskly took out a pair of scissors with which he cut his fingernails, and from the parings of his thumbnail he improvised a kind of speaking-trumpet, like a vast funnel, and put the end up to his ear.
211: In a small number of hours he was able to distinguish words, and finally to understand French.
217: The dwarf feared that his thunderous voice, and assuredly Micromegas, would deafen the mites without being understood.
219: They placed toothpicks in their mouths, whose tapered ends fell around the ship.
220: The Sirian put the dwarf on his knees and the ship with its crew on a fingernail.
221: He lowered his head and spoke softly.
222: Finally, relying on these precautions and many others, he began his speech like so: "Invisible insects, that the hand of the Creator has caused to spring up in the abyss of the infinitely small, I thank him for allowing me to uncover these seemingly impenetrable secrets.
224: If anyone has ever been surprised, it was the people who heard these words.
225: They could not figure out where they were coming from.
227: The dwarf from Saturn, who had a softer voice than Micromegas, told them in a few words what species they were dealing with.
228: He told them about the voyage from Saturn, brought them up to speed on what Mr. Micromegas was, and after lamenting how small they were, asked them if they had always been in this miserable state so near nothingness, what they were doing on a globe that appeared to belong to whales, whether they were happy, if they reproduced, if they had a soul, and a hundred other questions of this nature.
229: A reasoner among the troop, more daring than the others, and shocked that someone might doubt his soul, observed the interlocutor with sight-vanes pointed at a quarter circle from two different stations, and at the third spoke thusly: "You believe then, Sir, that because you are a thousand fathoms tall from head to toe, that you are a--" "A thousand fathoms!" cried the dwarf.
231: How could he know my height?
244: One of the philosophers responded that he could certainly imagine that there are intelligent beings much smaller than man.
246: He explained finally that there are animals that are to bees what bees are to man, what the Sirian himself was for the vast animals he had spoken of, and what these large animals are to other substances before which they looked like atoms.
251: At this all the philosophers shook their heads, and one of them, more frank than the others, avowed that if one excepts a small number of inhabitants held in poor regard, all the rest are an assembly of mad, vicious, and wretched people.
253: Did you know, for example, that as I am speaking with you, there are 100,000 madmen of our species wearing hats, killing 100,000 other animals wearing turbans, or being massacred by them, and that we have used almost surface of the Earth for this purpose since time immemorial?"
255: The Sirian shuddered, and asked the reason for these horrible quarrels between such puny animals.
256: "It is a matter," said the philosopher, "of some piles of mud as big as your heel.
257: It is not that any of these millions of men that slit each other's throats care about this pile of mud.
260: "Oh! Cruel fate!" cried the Sirian with indignation, "who could conceive of this excess of maniacal rage!
261: It makes me want to take three steps and crush this whole anthill of ridiculous assassins."
277: Finally Micromegas said to them, "Since you know what is exterior to you so well, you must know what is interior even better.
279: The philosophers spoke all at once as before, but they were of different views.
315: He did not find this the least bit sage, while the dwarf from Saturn would have kissed the sectarian of Locke were it not for the extreme disproportion.
319: He argued that their people, their worlds, their suns, their stars, had all been made uniquely for mankind.
320: At this speech, our two voyagers nearly fell over with that inextinguishable laughter which, according to Homer, is shared with the gods.
321: Their shoulders and their stomachs heaved up and down, and in these convulsions the vessel that the Sirian had on his nail fell into one of the Saturnian's trouser pockets.
323: The Sirian resumed his discussion with the little mites.
325: He promised to make them a beautiful philosophical book, written very small for their usage, and said that in this book they would see the point of everything.
326: Indeed, he gave them this book before leaving.
327: It was taken to the academy of science in Paris, but when the ancient secretary opened it, he saw nothing but blank pages.
