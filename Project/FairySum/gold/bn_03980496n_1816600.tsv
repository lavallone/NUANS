7: There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly: he was every morning the first out of bed, and the last to go to rest at night; and, whenever there was a difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he was always the first to set himself to it.
10: Then at last the servant said, "Master, for three years I have served you honestly, be so good as to give me what I ought to have; for I wish to leave, and look about me a little more in the world."
11: "Yes, my good fellow," answered the old miser; "you have served me industriously, and, therefore, you shall be cheerfully rewarded;" and he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three farthings, saying, "There, you have a farthing for each year; that is large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from few masters."
12: The honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought, "Ah! now that I have my purse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work!"
21: "Look here," said the dwarf, "I am a poor needy man, give me your three farthings; I can work no longer, but you are young, and can easily earn your bread."
22: And as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the old man, he gave him the three farthings, saying, "Take them in the name of Heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it."
23: Then the little man said, "As I see you have a good "Aha?" said the servant, "you are one of those who can work wonders!
24: Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for a gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at; secondly, for a fiddle, which when I play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance; thirdly, that if I ask a favour of any one he shall not be able to refuse it."
29: Soon afterwards he met a Jew with a long goat's-beard, who was standing listening to the song of a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree.
32: if only some one would sprinkle some salt upon its tail!"
33: "If that is all," said the servant, "the bird shall soon be down here;" and taking aim he pulled the trigger, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.
37: Then he lay down on the ground, and began to crawl into the thicket.
38: When he was fast among the thorns, the good servant's humour so tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play.
47: As soon as he had refreshed himself a little in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town to the justice.
52: So the judge sent his people out after the man, and they found the good servant, who had been going quite slowly along, and they found, too, the purse with the money upon him.
53: As soon as he was taken before the judge he said, "I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money; he gave it to me of his own free will, that I might leave off fiddling because he could not bear my music."
54: But the judge also did not believe his tale, and said, "This is a bad defence, no Jew would do that."
55: And because he had committed robbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be hanged.
59: The servant walked quietly with the hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round and said to the judge, "Grant me just one request before I die."
60: "Yes, if you do not ask your life," said the judge.
61: "I do not ask for life," answered the servant, "but as a last favour let me play once more upon my fiddle."
74: Soon all who had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing with them; old and young, fat and lean, one with another.
77: The good servant thereupon had compassion, took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again, and stepped down the ladder.
78: Then he went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground panting for breath, and said, "You rascal, now confess, whence you got the money, or I will take my fiddle and begin to play again."
79: "I stole it, I stole it!" cried he; "but you have honestly earned it."
80: So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief.
