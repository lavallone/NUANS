28: "I never thought I'd run another nuclear-bomb test, as long as I lived."
34: We made lots of experiments like this, back before 1969."
36: And the end result--the United States and the Soviet Union blasted to rubble, a whole hemisphere pushed back into the Dark Ages, a quarter of a billion dead.
42: "Before the Auburn Bomb."
43: In all the years they'd worked together at the _Instituto Argentino de Ciencia Fisica_, that had been unmentioned between them.
61: "I could never understand about that, Lee.
63: But I know that my government did not launch that missile.
64: During the first days after yours began coming in, I talked to people who had been in the Kremlin at the time.
67: We always believed that your government decided upon a preventive surprise attack, and picked out a town, Auburn, New York, that had been hit by one of our first retaliation missiles, and claimed that it had been hit first."
69: "Auburn was hit an hour before the first American missile was launched
71: We could never understand why you launched just that one, and no more until after ours began landing on you; why you threw away the advantage of surprise and priority of attack--"
76: After all that happened, and all that you, and I, and the people you worked with, and the people I worked with, and your government, and mine, have been guilty of, it would be a waste of breath for either of us to try to lie to the other about what happened fifteen years ago."
96: And, to complete the picture, here were Professor Doctor Lee Richardson and Comrade Professor Alexis Petrovitch Pitov, getting ready to test a missile with a matter-annihilation warhead.
152: We have just gotten a fifty kilogramme mass of nega-iron assembled.
170: So we're going to have the rocket eject it, and when it falls, we can see, by our telemetered instruments, just what happens."
205: In a moment, now, the rocket, a hundred miles overhead, would be nosing down, and then the warhead would open and the magnetic field inside would alter and the mass of negamatter would be ejected.
210: Then the right hand screen broke into a wriggling orgy of color, and at the same time every scrap of radio-transmitted apparatus either went out or began reporting erratically.
212: For a moment, Richardson wondered what was going on, and then shocked recognition drove that from his mind as he stared at the ever-brightening glare in the sky.
213: It was the Auburn Bomb again!
276: I wondered about that at the time--what kind of a missile would produce an effect like that.
277: Now I know.
285: When that negamatter meteor fell, the only thing anybody could think of was that it had been a Soviet missile.
