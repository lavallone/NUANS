0: ALYOSHA was the younger brother.
1: He was called the Pot, because his mother had once sent him with a pot of milk to the deacon's wife, and he had stumbled against something and broken it.
4: Alyosha was a tiny, thin little fellow, with ears like wings, and a huge nose.
7: Alyosha went to the village school, but was not good at lessons; besides, there was so little time to learn.
8: His elder brother was in town, working for a merchant, so Alyosha had to help his father from a very early age.
15: Alyosha was nineteen when his brother was taken as a soldier.
16: So his father placed him with the merchant as a yard-porter.
27: So Alyosha remained at the merchant's.
28: The family was not a large one.
33: They sent him on all sorts of errands, but he did everything quickly and readily, going from one task to another without stopping.
59: At holiday times there was more work than ever, but Alyosha liked holidays because everybody gave him a tip.
63: His father used to come and take them from the merchant, and only scold Alyosha for wearing out his boots.
65: Alyosha was not talkative; when he spoke at all, he spoke abruptly, with his head turned away.
67: Alyosha did not know any prayer; and had forgotten what his mother had taught him.
69: He lived like this for about a year and a half, and towards the end of the second year a most startling thing happened to him.
70: He discovered one day, to his great surprise, that, in addition to the relation of usefulness existing between people, there was also another, a peculiar relation of quite a different character.
71: Instead of a man being wanted to clean boots, and go on errands and harness horses, he is not wanted to be of any service at all, but another human being wants to serve him and pet him.
73: He made this discovery through the cook Ustinia.
90: He had heard that peasants who came up to work in the towns frequently got married to servant girls.
91: On one occasion she asked him if his parents intended marrying him soon.
92: He said that he did not know; that he did not want to marry any of the village girls.
94: "I would marry you, if you'd be willing."
98: At Shrovetide Alyosha's father came to town for his wages.
99: It had come to the ears of the merchant's wife that Alyosha wanted to marry Ustinia, and she disapproved of it.
101: she thought, and informed her husband.
102: The merchant gave the old man Alyosha's wages.
114: He went into the kitchen, and sat down at the table waiting for his son.
121: They tell me you want to get married.
122: You shall get married when the time comes.
125: When his father had quite finished, Alyosha smiled.
129: When he was left alone with Ustinia he told her what his father had said.
141: From that day Alyosha went about his work as usual, and no longer talked to Ustinia about their getting married.
142: One day in Lent the clerk told him to clear the snow from the roof.
143: Alyosha climbed on to the roof and swept away all the snow; and, while he was still raking out some frozen lumps from the gutter, his foot slipped and he fell over.
144: Unfortunately he did not fall on the snow, but on a piece of iron over the door.
150: The doctor arrived, examined him, and asked where he felt the pain.
151: "I feel it all over," he said.
155: Alyosha lay in bed for two days, and on the third day they sent for the priest.
169: He spoke very little; he only said he was thirsty, and he seemed full of wonder at something.
170: He lay in wonderment, then stretched himself, and died.
