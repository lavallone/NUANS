1: We were becalmed in the Northern Pacific.
5: Suddenly, from out of the surrounding darkness, there came a hail: “Schooner, ahoy!”
65: I would not have troubled you, only I am hungry, and—so is she.”
81: “I dare not come nearer.
110: I said, full of many feelings, over which predominated a vast sympathy.
111: “Get a box.
112: We must float off the stuff to him in it.”
113: This we did, propelling it away from the vessel, out into the darkness, by means of a boat hook.
115: A little later he called out a farewell to us, and so heartful a blessing, that I am sure we were the better for it.
125: The third hour was three parts through when we heard again the sound of oars across the silent ocean.
135: “The—lady is grateful now on earth.
136: She will be more grateful soon in—in heaven.”
145: We had thought to go out, without telling anyone of the terror which has come into our—lives.
147: “Since the sinking of the Albatross.”
153: When the day came, it was found that she was leaking badly, and, presently, it falling to a calm, the sailors took to the boats, leaving—leaving a young lady—my fiancée—and myself upon the wreck.
158: Then, the vessel being very deep in the water, we got ourselves onto the raft and pushed off.
165: “When the morning came, we found that we were in a sort of great lagoon; but of this we noticed little at the time; for close before us, through the enshrouding mist, loomed the hull of a large sailing vessel.
184: “Together we explored the cabins and apartments in the after part of the ship; but nowhere was there any sign of life.
193: Yet even thus early we became aware that our lot was even less to be desired than might have been imagined; for though, as a first step, we scraped away the odd patches of growth that studded the floors and walls of the cabins and saloon, yet they returned almost to their original size within the space of twenty-four hours, which not only discouraged us but gave us a feeling of vague unease.
196: “On the seventh morning, my sweetheart woke to find a small patch of it growing on her pillow, close to her face.
200: When I saw the thing upon her pillow I shuddered, and then and there we agreed to go right out of the ship and see whether we could not fare to make ourselves more comfortable ashore.
208: “At first, it seemed to us that there was no single portion of the surrounding shore which was not hidden beneath the masses of the hideous lichen; yet, in this, I found we were mistaken; for somewhat later, coasting along the shore at a little distance, we descried a smooth white patch of what appeared to be fine sand, and there we landed.
217: “It was on the thumb of her right hand that the growth first showed.
303: Yet our drear punishment was upon us; for, day by day, with monstrous rapidity, the fungoid growth took hold of our poor bodies.
318: The sun flung a stray beam across the hidden sea; pierced the mist dully, and lit up the receding boat with a gloomy fire.
319: Indistinctly I saw something nodding between the oars.
