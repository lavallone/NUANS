40: The big canoe glided on swiftly, noiselessly, and smoothly, towards Arsat's clearing, till, in a great rattling of poles thrown down, and the loud murmurs of "Allah be praised!"
41: it came with a gentle knock against the crooked piles below the house.
45: The white man began to climb the rude ladder giving access to the bamboo platform before the house.
49: Then the boat shoved off, and the white man, standing up, confronted Arsat, who had come out through the low door of his hut.
73: He had known Arsat years ago, in a far country in times of trouble and danger, when no friendship is to be despised.
126: Arsat went on with mournful composure-- "Therefore I shall speak to you of love.
130: "After the time of trouble and war was over and you went away from my country in the pursuit of your desires, which we, men of the islands, cannot understand, I and my brother became again, as we had been before, the sword-bearers of the Ruler.
135: But the sower watched the young rice-shoots grow up without fear, and the traders came and went, departed lean and returned fat into the river of peace.
138: We heard from them about you also.
140: And I was glad to hear, for I remembered the stirring times, and I always remembered you, Tuan, till the time came when my eyes could see nothing in the past, because they had looked upon the one who is dying there--in the house."
143: then went on speaking a little louder: "There's no worse enemy and no better friend than a brother, Tuan, for one brother knows another, and in perfect knowledge is strength for good or evil.
145: I went to him and told him that I could see nothing but one face, hear nothing but one voice.
151: You remember the lady with the veiled face, Tuan, and the fear of our Ruler before her cunning and temper.
152: And if she wanted her servant, what could I do?
162: My brother said, 'You shall take her from their midst.
168: While they were making the boats ready to beat up the fish, my brother came to me and said, 'To-night!'
178: My brother said gloomily, 'Go and take her; carry her into our boat.'
212: We paddled with haste, breathing through our teeth.
217: Only once I said, 'Sleep, Diamelen, for soon you may want all your strength.'
231: My ribs were ready to burst, but I could no longer get enough air into my chest.
232: And then I felt I must cry out with my last breath, 'Let us rest!' . . .
242: "We ran our canoe on the white beach of a little bay close to a long tongue of land that seemed to bar our road; a long wooded cape going far into the sea.
249: The sun was halfway down the sky already, and coming in sight in the opening of the bay we saw a prau manned by many paddlers.
250: We knew it at once; it was one of our Rajah's praus.
256: My brother laughed.
257: He had the gun you had given him, Tuan, before you went away, but there was only a handful of powder.
258: He spoke to me quickly: 'Run with her along the path.
261: On the other side of that wood there is a fisherman's house--and a canoe.
262: When I have fired all the shots I will follow.
281: I heard yells behind me, and I saw my brother run across the glade.
282: Many men were bounding after him, I took her in my arms and threw her into the boat, then leaped in myself.
283: When I looked back I saw that my brother had fallen.
284: He fell and was up again, but the men were closing round him.
290: Tuan, I pushed the canoe!
294: I heard him cry my name twice; and I heard voices shouting, 'Kill!
297: I heard him calling my name again with a great shriek, as when life is going out together with the voice--and I never turned my head.
311: I had her!
313: But I had her--and--"
334: Then he said-- "She burns no more."
339: Arsat's eyes wandered slowly, then stared at the rising sun.
345: "I shall not eat or sleep in this house, but I must first see my road.
347: There is no light and no peace in the world; but there is death--death for many.
348: We are sons of the same mother--and I left him in the midst of enemies; but I am going back now."
349: He drew a long breath and went on in a dreamy tone: "In a little while I shall see clear enough to strike--to strike.
354: The white man got down into his canoe.
358: Before the sampan passed out of the lagoon into the creek he lifted his eyes.
359: Arsat had not moved.
360: He stood lonely in the searching sunshine; and he looked beyond the great light of a cloudless day into the darkness of a world of illusions.
