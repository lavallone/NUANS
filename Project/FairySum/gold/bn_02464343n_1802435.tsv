0: Horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend, Crawford Tillinghast.
2: I had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine, eating little and excluding even the servants, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature.
6: That Crawford Tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake.
11: "What do we know," he had said, "of the world and the universe about us?
17: Within twenty-four hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized sense organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges.
18: Those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life.
20: We shall see these things, and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen.
40: He now seated me near the machine, so that it was on my right, and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs.
53: Here Tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me, blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes.
54: "Your existing sense-organs—ears first, I think—will pick up many of the impressions, for they are closely connected with the dormant organs.
56: You have heard of the pineal gland?
58: That gland is the great sense organ of organs—I have found out.
59: It is like sight in the end, and transmits visual pictures to the brain.
60: If you are normal, that is the way you ought to get most of it...
61: I mean get most of the evidence from beyond."
74: Tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which I had almost unconsciously drawn, but from his expression I was sure he had seen and heard as much as I, if not a great deal more.
76: "Don't move," he cautioned, "for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to see.
77: I told you the servants left, but I didn't tell you how.
78: It was that thick-witted house-keeper—she turned on the lights downstairs after I had warned her not to, and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations.
79: It must have been frightful—I could hear the screams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from another direction, and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house.
84: Keep still!"
89: After that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in the jumble of sights, sounds, and unidentified sense-impressions I felt that I was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form.
92: At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body, and thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually.
98: Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien, unknown entities.
99: It likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa.
104: Shudderingly I felt that I knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants, and could not exclude the thing from my mind as I strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us.
105: But Tillinghast had been watching me and was speaking.
106: "You see them?
118: What swept up the servants?
129: It is you they will get, as they got the servants...
144: Well, don't worry, my friend, for they are coming...
146: it's just over your left shoulder..."
148: The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast house and found us there—Tillinghast dead and me unconscious.
149: They arrested me because the revolver was in my hand, but released me in three hours, after they found it was apoplexy which had finished Tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor.
154: What prevents me from believing the doctor is one simple fact—that the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say Crawford Tillinghast murdered.
