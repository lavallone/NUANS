7: A terrible sacrilege had been committed.
14: Hourly there was expectancy of some great calamity to befall.
17: Unlessâ€”unless the sacrilege were avenged.
20: Pharaoh alone had committed the sacrilege.
21: It was he, angered because the bridge, which he had spent five years in constructing so that one day he might cross the Nile in his chariot as he had once boasted that he would do, had been swept away by the rising waters.
23: He had barred the temple doors and with his own breath had blown out the sacred candles.
28: Standing before the awed assembly of nobles, the high Kha Semblor made a gesture with his hands.
31: Death had been pronounced as doom for the pharaoh.
33: The crowd came out, and within an hour a well-organized mob passed through the streets of Thebes, directed for the palace of the pharaoh.
35: Within the resplendent portals of the palace the pharaoh, ruler of all Egypt, watched with tightened brow the orderly but menacing approach of the mob.
39: A woman clung to his stiffened arm.
42: She was the fair and well-loved Nitocris; sister of the pharaoh.
48: He thrust aside his pleading sister, and beckoned to the attendants.
75: They surged forward.
76: The struggling body of the pharaoh was lifted up and torn to pieces by their clawing hands and weapons.
77: Thus was the god Osiris avenged.
80: A week later another large assembly of persons confronted the brilliant-pillared palace.
82: The week before they had rended the pharaoh and now they were proclaiming his sister empress.
89: Not long after the beauteous Nitocris mounted the golden throne of Egypt, rumors were whispered of some vast, mysterious enterprise being conducted in secret.
101: It was temple to the god Osiris.
102: It had been built by the queen probably that she might partly atone for the sacrilege of her brother and deliver him from some of the torture which he undoubtedly suffered.
104: All the nobles and the high priests of Osiris, of which there were a tremendous number, were to be invited.
108: The day of the dedication, which was to be followed by the night of banqueting, was a gala holiday.
127: On the interior the guests were inspired to even greater wonderment.
154: Immediately all of the guests gathered around the banquet tables, and the next hour was occupied in gluttonous feasting.
172: When the hour had approached near to midnight, the queen, who had sat like one entranced, arose from the cushioned dais.
202: Grasped in her hand was an instrument which could release awful death upon those against whom she wished vengeance.
206: This was the lever that opened the wall in the banquet vault.
225: Then it was that a few noticed the slab to have been replaced, shutting them in.
239: With the ferocity of a lion springing into the arena of a Roman amphitheater to devour the gladiators set there for its delectation, the black water plunged in.
241: In a moment that icy, black water had risen to their knees, although the room was vast.
247: The gorgeous trumpery of banquet invaded by howling waters of death!
252: Here in the temple of Osiris those nobles and priests who had slain the pharaoh in expiation of his sacrilege against Osiris had now met their deaths.
269: When in the evening the queen arrived in the city, pale, silent, and obviously nervous, threatening crowds blocked the path of her chariot, demanding roughly an explanation of the disappearance of her guests.
271: Well she knew, however, that her life would be doomed as soon as they confirmed their suspicions.
273: Therefore upon her entrance into the palace she ordered her slaves to fill instantly her boudoir with hot and smoking ashes.
275: In a short time the scorching heat and the suffocating thick fumes of the smoke overpowered her.
