0: There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I will tell of the Street.
2: At first it was but a path trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach.
3: Then, as more men came to the growing cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell, they built cabins along the north side, cabins of stout oaken logs with masonry on the side toward the forest, for many Indians lurked there with fire-arrows.
4: And in a few years more, men built cabins on the south side of the Street.
5: Up and down the Street walked grave men in conical hats, who most of the time carried muskets or fowling pieces.
6: And there were also their bonneted wives and sober children.
10: There was war, and thereafter no more Indians troubled the Street.
12: And the children grew up comfortable, and more families came from the Mother Land to dwell on the Street.
14: The town was now a city, and one by one the cabins gave place to houses—simple, beautiful houses of brick and wood, with stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors.
19: Books and paintings and music came to the houses, and the young men went to the university which rose above the plain to the north.
20: In the place of conical hats and muskets there were three-cornered hats and small-swords, and lace and snowy periwigs.
22: There were in that Street many trees: elms and oaks and maples of dignity; so that in the summer, the scene was all soft verdure and twittering bird-song.
23: And behind the houses were walled rose-gardens with hedged paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew.
25: Once, most of the young men went away, and some never came back.
26: That was when they furled the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars.
28: And the trees still sheltered singing birds, and at evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy blossoms in the walled rose-gardens.
29: In time there were no more swords, three-cornered hats, or periwigs in the Street.
30: How strange seemed the inhabitants with their walking-sticks, tall beavers, and cropped heads!
32: The air was not quite so pure as before, but the spirit of the place had not changed.
34: Nor did the spirit change when they tore open the earth to lay down strange pipes, or when they set up tall posts bearing weird wires.
36: Then came days of evil, when many who had known the Street of old knew it no more, and many knew it who had not known it before, and went away, for their accents were coarse and strident, and their mien and faces unpleasing.
37: Their thoughts, too, fought with the wise, just spirit of the Street, so that the Street pined silently as its houses fell into decay, and its trees died one by one, and its rose-gardens grew rank with weeds and waste.
38: But it felt a stir of pride one day when again marched forth young men, some of whom never came back.
39: These young men were clad in blue.
40: With the years, worse fortune came to the Street.
41: Its trees were all gone now, and its rose-gardens were displaced by the backs of cheap, ugly new buildings on parallel streets.
43: New kinds of faces appeared in the Street, swarthy, sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features, whose owners spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and unknown characters upon most of the musty houses.
47: War and revolution were raging across the seas; a dynasty had collapsed, and its degenerate subjects were flocking with dubious intent to the Western Land.
48: Many of these took lodgings in the battered houses that had once known the songs of birds and the scent of roses.
49: Then the Western Land itself awoke and joined the Mother Land in her titanic struggle for civilization.
50: Over the cities once more floated the old flag, companioned by the new flag, and by a plainer, yet glorious tricolour.
55: Over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the young men returned.
56: Those who had lacked something lacked it no longer, yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the Street; for many had stayed behind, and many strangers had come from distance places to the ancient houses.
58: Swarthy and sinister were most of the strangers, yet among them one might find a few faces like those who fashioned the Street and moulded its spirit.
59: Like and yet unlike, for there was in the eyes of all a weird, unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition, vindictiveness, or misguided zeal.
60: Unrest and treason were abroad amongst an evil few who plotted to strike the Western Land its death blow, that they might mount to power over its ruins, even as assassins had mounted in that unhappy, frozen land from whence most of them had come.
61: And the heart of that plotting was in the Street, whose crumbling houses teemed with alien makers of discord and echoed with the plans and speeches of those who yearned for the appointed day of blood, flame and crime.
63: With great diligence did men of hidden badges linger and listen about such places as Petrovitch’s Bakery, the squalid Rifkin School of Modern Economics, the Circle Social Club, and the Liberty Cafe.
64: There congregated sinister men in great numbers, yet always was their speech guarded or in a foreign tongue.
65: And still the old houses stood, with their forgotten lore of nobler, departed centuries; of sturdy Colonial tenants and dewy rose-gardens in the moonlight.
67: The rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of a vast band of terrorists, who on a designated day were to launch an orgy of slaughter for the extermination of America and of all the fine old traditions which the Street had loved.
70: It was said that the swart men who dwelt in the Street and congregated in its rotting edifices were the brains of a hideous revolution, that at their word of command many millions of brainless, besotted beasts would stretch forth their noisome talons from the slums of a thousand cities, burning, slaying, and destroying till the land of our fathers should be no more.
71: All this was said and repeated, and many looked forward in dread to the fourth day of July, about which the strange writings hinted much; yet could nothing be found to place the guilt.
76: So the Street slept uneasily on, till one night there gathered in Petrovitch’s Bakery, and the Rifkin School of Modern Economics, and the Circle Social Club, and Liberty Cafe, and in other places as well, vast hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and expectation.
80: It was known that this nest of anarchy was old, and that the houses were tottering from the ravages of the years and the storms and worms; yet was the happening of that summer night a surprise because of its very queer uniformity.
82: For without warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after the crash there was nothing left standing in the Street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall.
83: Nor did anything that had been alive come alive from the ruins.
84: A poet and a traveler, who came with the mighty crowd that sought the scene, tell odd stories.
85: The poet says that all through the hours before dawn he beheld sordid ruins indistinctly in the glare of the arc-lights; that there loomed above the wreckage another picture wherein he could describe moonlight and fair houses and elms and oaks and maples of dignity.
86: And the traveler declares that instead of the place’s wonted stench there lingered a delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom.
88: There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I have told you of the Street.
