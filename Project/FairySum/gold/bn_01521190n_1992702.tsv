0: Claude Gueux was a poor workman, living in Paris about eight years ago, with his mistress and child.
1: Although his education had been neglected, and he could not even read, the man was naturally clever and intelligent, and thought deeply over matters.
4: The man turned thief.
6: What signifies, as the result was the same: to the woman and child it gave three days' bread and warmth; to the man, five years' imprisonment.
7: He was taken to Clairvaux,—the abbey now converted into a prison, its cells into dungeons, and the altar itself into a pillory.
21: After a time Claude had accustomed himself to prison rule, and by his calmness of manner and a certain amount of resolution clearly marked in his face, he had acquired a great ascendancy over his companions, who so much admired him that they asked his advice, and tried in all ways to imitate him.
24: Such popularity ever has as its attendant hatred; and though beloved by the prisoners, Claude was detested by the jailers.
27: When a free man, Claude Gueux could earn his daily four-pound loaf and enjoy it; but as a prisoner he daily worked, and for his labour received one pound and a half of bread and four ounces of meat; it naturally followed that he was always hungry.
28: He had just finished his meagre fare, and was about to resume his labours, hoping in work to forget famine, when a weakly-looking young man came towards him, holding a knife and his untasted rations in his hand, but seemingly afraid to address him.
32: "Help me with my rations; I have more than I can eat."
34: "Thank you," said the young man; "allow me to share my rations with you every day."
41: The same scene took place daily between this man old before his time (he was only thirty-six) and the boy of twenty, who looked at the most seventeen.
42: The feeling was more like that of father and son than one brother to another; everything created a bond of union between them,—the very toil they endured together, the fact of sleeping in the same quarters and taking exercise in the same courtyard.
44: The inspector of the workshop was so hated by the prisoners that he often had recourse to Claude Gueux to enforce his authority; and when a tumult was on the point of breaking out, a few words from Claude had more effect than the authority of the warders.
45: Although the inspector was glad to avail himself of this influence, he was jealous all the same, and hated the superior prisoner with an envious and implacable feeling,—an example of might over right, all the more fearful as it was secretly nourished.
47: One morning as th warders were going their rounds one of them summoned Albin, who was working with Claude, to go before the inspector.
50: All day Claude looked in vain for his companion, and at night, finding him still absent, he broke though his ordinary reserve and addressed the turnkey.
60: "Sir," said Claude, as the inspector was about to pass him, "has Albin really been quartered elsewhere?"
64: Could you not manage to let him resume his old place near me?"
65: "Impossible; the order cannot be revoked."
72: "Why, then," cried Claude, "separate me from Albin?"
73: "Because I do," replied the inspector, and with that he passed on.
80: On the 25th of October, 1831, as the inspector went his rounds, Claude, to draw his attention, smashed a watch-glass he had found in the passage.
83: "Sir, resore my comrade to me."
84: "Impossible," was the answer.
92: Claude daily impressed the fact on the inspector how much Albin's absence affected him, but with no result save four-and-twenty hours' solitary confinement.
93: On the 4th of November he looked round his cell for the little that remained to remind him of his former life.
94: A pair of scissors, and an old volume of the "Emile," belonging to the woman he had loved so well, the mother of his child,—how useless to a man who could neither work nor read!
102: Without exacting any promises of secrecy he at once replied: "To kill the inspector with tonight."
106: Just then Faillette asked what he was hiding.
107: Claude answered unhestitatingly: "An axe to kill Monsieur D____ tonight; but can you see it?"
132: As the clock sounded the last quarter to nine, Claude rose and placed himself near the entrance, apparently calm.
133: Amidst the most profound silence the clock struck nine; the door was thrown open, and the inspector came in as usual alone, looking quite jovial and self-satisfied, passing rapidly along, tossing his head at one, grinding words out to another, little heeding the eyes fixed so fiercely upon him.
134: Just then he heard Claude's step, and turning quickly round said, — "What are you doing here?
141: Claude, following him closely, replied: "Sir, return my companion to me!"
153: "Impossible!" replied the inspector impatiently; "I will not recall my words.
157: Why did you separate us?"
158: "I have already answered you: because I chose," replied the inspector.
159: With that he was about to lift the latch, when Claude raised the axe, and without one cry the inspector fell to the ground, with his skull completely cloven from three heavy blows dealt with the rapidity of lightning.
161: Claude, throwing the axe aside, cried out, "Now for the other!"
162: The other was himself; and taking the scissors, his wife's, he plunged them into his breast.
166: When Claude regained consciousness he was in bed, surrounded by every care and covered with bandages.
169: Then the interrogatory commenced.
170: "Did you kill the inspector of the prison workshops at Clairvaux?"
171: "Yes," was the reply.
176: On the 16th of March, 1832, perfectly cured, Claude appeared in court at Troyes, to answer the charge brought against him.
179: But an unexpected dificulty occurred; not one of these men would give evidence; neither questions nor threats availed to make them break their silence, until Claude requested them to do so.
180: Then they in turn gave a faithful account of the terrible event; and if one, from forgetfullness or affection for the accused, failed to relate the whole facts, Claude supplied the deficiency.
190: In a clear and straightforward way he detailed the facts as they were, — standing proudly there, resolved to tell the whole truth.
193: Once Claude lost his temper, when the counsel for the prosecution stated that he had assassinated the inspector without provocation.
197: But a man who wounds me in every way during four years, humiliates me for four years, taunts me daily, hourly, for four years, and heaps every insult on my head,—what follows?
198: You consider I have had no provocation!
213: The jury retired for a quarter of an hour, and according to the judgment of these twelve countrymen—gentlemen of the jury, as they are styled—Claude Gueux was condemned to death.
219: He refused to make any appeal until the last minute, but at the instance of one of the sisters who had nursed him he consented to do so.
221: His fellow prisoners, as we have already noticed, were devoted to him, and placed all the means at their disposal to help him to escape.
224: On the 8th of June, 1832, seven months and four days after the murder, the recorder of the court came, and Claude was told that he had but one hour more to live, for his appeal had been rejected.
226: First came the priest, then the executioner.
236: He wished to embrace the priest and the executioner, thanking the one and pardoning the other; the executioner simply repulsed him.
237: Just before he was bound to the infernal machine, he gave the five franc piece to the priest, saying, "For the poor."
239: A market-day had been chosen for the time of execution, as there would be more people about, for there are still in France small towns that glory in having an execution.
240: The guillotine that day remained, inflaming the imagination of the mob to such an extent that one of the tax-gatherers was nearly murdered.
250: An intelligent and most noble-hearted man, placed in the midst of evil surroundings, he turned thief.
251: Society placed him in a prison where the evil was yet greater, and he ended up becoming a murderer.
253: The facts are now before us, and if the government gives no thought to the matter, what are the rulers about?
269: The question is this: In the name of justice, scarcely a year ago, a man at Panners was cut to pieces; at Dijon a woman's head was taken off; in Paris, at St. Jacques, executions take place without number.
273: Whether a republic or a monarchy, the fact remains the same,—the people suffer!
275: Such misery leads them to crime: the galleys take the sons, houses of ill-fame the daughters.
295: Fancy, Switzerland can read, Belgium can read, Denmark can read, Greece can read, Ireland can read — and France cannot read!
296: It is a crying evil.
297: "Go into our convict prisons, examine each one of these condemned men, and you will observe by the profile, the shape of the head, how many could find their type in the lower animals.
300: Then give the people a fair education, and what there is of good in these ill-conditioned minds, let that be developed.
303: "When France can read, then give the people encouragement for higher things.
314: "Then give the people all encouragement; improve the masses, enlighten them, guard their morals, make them useful, and to such heads as those you will not require to use cold steel."
