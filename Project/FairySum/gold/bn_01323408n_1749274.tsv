0: By THE light of a tallow candle, which had been placed on one end of a rough table, a man was reading something written in a book.
1: It was an old account book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently, very legible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of the candle to get a stronger light upon it.
2: The shadow of the book would then throw into obscurity a half of the room, darkening a number of faces and figures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present.
3: Seven of them sat against the rough log walls, silent and motionless, and, the room being small, not very far from the table.
4: By extending an arm any one of them could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the table, face upward, partly covered by a sheet, his arms at his sides.
5: He was dead.
6: The man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all seemed to be waiting for something to occur; the dead man only was without expectation.
9: They were evidently men of the vicinity--farmers and woodmen.
10: The person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him that he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his attire which attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his environment.
13: For he was a coroner.
14: It was by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which he was reading; it had been found among the dead man's effects--in his cabin, where the inquest was now taking place.
15: When the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast pocket.
16: At that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered.
40: "What is your name?"
41: the coroner asked.
42: "William Harker."
59: "Relate the circumstances of this man's death," said the coroner.
61: The witness understood.
62: Pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket he held it near the candle, and turning the leaves until he found the passage that he wanted, began to read.
64: We were looking for quail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog.
68: Suddenly, we heard, at a little distance to our right, and partly in front, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we could see were violently agitated.
81: What the devil is it?'
82: I asked.
83: "'That Damned Thing!'
96: My companion appeared actually frightened, and I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his gun to his shoulders and fire both barrels at the agitated grass!
98: At the same instant I was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something unseen in the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown against me with great force.
99: "Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to have been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in mortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds as one hears from fighting dogs.
101: At a distance of less than thirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown back at a frightful angle, hatless, his long hair in disorder and his whole body in violent movement from side to side, backward and forward.
107: During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard, as if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I had never heard from the throat of man or brute!
108: "For a moment only I stood irresolute, then, throwing down my gun, I ran forward to my friend's assistance.
109: I had a vague belief that he was suffering from a fit or some form of convulsion.
110: Before I could reach his side he was down and quiet.
113: He was dead."
130: The foreman rose--a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarsely clad.
132: "What asylum did this year last witness escape from?"
133: "Mr. Harker," said the coroner, gravely and tranquilly, "from what asylum did you last escape?"
134: Harker flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven jurors rose and solemnly filed out of the cabin.
135: "If you have done insulting me, sir," said Harker, as soon as he and the officer were left alone with the dead man, "I suppose I am at liberty to go?"
136: "Yes." Harker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.
138: He turned about and said: "The book that you have there--I recognize it as Morgan's diary.
142: "The book will cut no figure in this matter," replied the official, slipping it into his coat pocket; "all the entries in it were made before the writer's death."
143: As Harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the table on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp definition.
144: The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced from his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather laboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort all signed: "We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits."
145: In the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries having, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions.
153: "Sept 2.--Looking at the stars last night as they rose above the crest of the ridge east of the house, I observed them successively disappear--from left to right.
155: It was as if something had passed along between me and them; but I could not see it, and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline.
159: "Sept. 27.--It has been about here again--I find evidences of its presence every day.
168: "Oct. 5.--I can stand it no longer; I have invited Harker to pass a few weeks with me--he has a level head.
169: I can judge from his manner if he thinks me mad.
172: "There are sounds that we can not hear.
184: "As with sounds, so with colors.
185: At each end of the solar spectrum the chemist can detect the presence of what are known as 'actinic' rays.
186: They represent colors--integral colors in the composition of light-- which we are unable to discern.
187: The human eye is an imperfect instrument; its range is but a few octaves of the real 'chromatic scale' I am not mad; there are colors that we can not see.
189: the Damned Thing is of such a color!"
