0: We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag.
1: For some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.
3: You suppose me a very old man—but I am not.
4: It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow.
11: "We are now," he continued, in that particularizing manner which distinguished him—"we are now close upon the Norwegian coast—in the sixty- eighth degree of latitude—in the great province of Nordland—and in the dreary district of Lofoden.
31: As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward.
32: Even while I gazed, this current acquired a monstrous velocity.
34: In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway.
43: "This," said I at length, to the old man—"this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelström."
71: "You have had a good look at the whirl now," said the old man, "and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström."
72: I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.
73: "Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh.
89: It was on the tenth day of July, 18—, a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget—for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens.
91: "The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we had ever known them.
99: In less than a minute the storm was upon us—in less than two the sky was entirely overcast—and what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.
107: For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast.
117: With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!
148: "It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it.
149: Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.
151: "It may look like boasting—but what I tell you is truth—I began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power.
153: After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself.
177: "Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with which I gazed about me.
190: "Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl.
195: I must have been delirious—for I even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below.
204: I made, also, three important observations.
205: The first was, that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their descent—the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other of any other shape'', the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere—the third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.
226: I was borne violently into the channel of the Ström, and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen.
231: I told them my story—they did not believe it.
232: I now tell it to you—and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden."
