0: Sheehan's Pool Room, which adorns one of the lesser alleys in the heart of Chicago's stockyard district, is not a nice place.
3: Over and above the fumes and sickening closeness rises an aroma once familiar throughout the land, but now happily banished to the back streets of life by the edict of a benevolent governmentâ€”the aroma of strong, wicked whiskeyâ€”a precious kind of forbidden fruit indeed in this year of grace 1950.
4: Sheehan's is the acknowledged centre to Chicago's subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attaches of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignityâ€”one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of Sheehan's.
5: He was called "Old Bugs", and was the most disreputable object in a disreputable environment.
8: One night he had burst wildly into Sheehan's, foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hasheesh; and having been supplied in exchange for a promise to perform odd jobs, had hung about ever since, mopping floors, cleaning cuspidors and glasses, and attending to an hundred similar menial duties in exchange for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive and sane.
9: He talked but little, and usually in the common jargon of the underworld; but occasionally, when inflamed by an unusually generous dose of crude whiskey, would burst forth into strings of incomprehensible polysyllables and snatches of sonorous prose and verse which led certain habituÃ©s to conjecture that he had seen better days.
30: I do not think that many of Sheehan's regular patrons will ever forget the day that young Alfred Trever came.
31: He was rather a "find"â€”a rich and high-spirited youth who would "go the limit" in anything he undertookâ€”at least, that was the verdict of Pete Schultz, Sheehan's "runner", who had come across the boy at Lawrence College, in the small town of Appleton, Wisconsin.
32: Trever was the son of prominent parents in Appleton.
33: His father, Karl Trever, was an attorney and citizen of distinction, whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a poetess under her maiden name of Eleanor Wing.
51: Now, in spite of all that guidance, Alfred Trever was at Sheehan's and about to take his first drink.
66: "I want whiskeyâ€”good old-fashioned rye!" exclaimed Trever enthusiastically.
82: Old Bugs, springing up from the crouching position in which he had hitherto been, leaped at the youth and dashed from his hands the uplifted glass, almost simultaneously attacking the tray of bottles and glasses with his mop, and scattering the contents upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles and tumblers.
84: Old Bugs straightened up before the astonished Trever, and in a mild and cultivated voice said, "Do not do this thing.
85: I was like you once, and I did it.
86: Now I am likeâ€”this."
