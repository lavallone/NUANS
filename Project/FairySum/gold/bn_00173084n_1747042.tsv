0: Once on a time there was an old widow who lived far away from the rest of the world, up under a hill-side, with her three daughters.
1: She was so poor that she had no stock but one single hen, which she prized as the apple of her eye; in short, it was always cackling at her heels, and she was always running to look after it.
2: Well! one day, all at once, the hen was missing.
4: So the woman said to her eldest daughter, "You must just go out and see if you can find our hen, for have it back we must, even if we have to fetch it out of the hill."
6: the daughter was ready enough to go, so she set off and walked up and down, and looked and called, but no hen could she find.
7: But all at once, just as she was about to give up the hunt, she heard some one calling out in a cleft in the rock—
10: So she went into the cleft to see what it was, but she had scarce set her foot inside the cleft, before she fell through a trap-door, deep, deep down, into a vault under ground.
11: When she got to the bottom she went through many rooms, each finer than the other; but in the   room of all, a great ugly man of the hill-folk came up to her and asked, "Will you be my sweetheart?"
12: "No! I will not," she said.
15: Then the Man o' the Hill got so angry that he took her up and wrung her head off, and threw both head and trunk down into the cellar.
16: While this was going on, her mother sat at home waiting and waiting, but no daughter came.
17: So, after she had waited a bit longer, and neither heard nor saw anything of her daughter, she said to her midmost daughter, that she must go out and see after her sister, and she added— "You can just give our hen a call at the same time."
18: Well! the second sister had to set off, and the very same thing befell her; she went about looking and calling, and all at once she too heard a voice away in the cleft of the rock saying—
21: She thought this strange, and went to see what it could be; and so she too fell through the trap-door, deep, deep down, into the vault.
22: There she went from room to room, and in the innermost one the Man o' the Hill came to her and asked if she would be his sweetheart?
23: No! that she wouldn't; all she wanted was to get above ground again, and hunt for her hen which was lost.
24: So the Man o' the Hill got angry, and took her up and wrung her head off, and threw both head and trunk down into the cellar.
25: Now, when the old dame had sat and waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her second daughter, and could neither see nor hear anything of her, she said to the youngest— "Now, you really must set off and see after your sisters.
29: So at last she too came up to the cleft in the rock, and heard how something said
32: She thought this strange, so she too went to see what it was, and fell through the trap-door too, deep, deep down, into a vault.
34: So, as she was peeping into this and that, she cast her eye on the trap-door into the cellar, and looked down it, and what should she see there but her sisters, who lay dead.
35: She had scarce time to slam to the trap-door before the Man o' the Hill came to her and asked— "Will you be my sweetheart?"
36: "With all my heart." answered the girl, for she saw very well how it had gone with her sisters.
39: So the Man o' the Hill asked her what was the matter, and why she was in such dumps.
40: "Ah!" said the girl, "it's because I can't get home to my mother.
42: " Well!" said the Man o' the Hill, "I can't let you go to see her; but just stuff some meat and drink into a sack, and I'll carry it to her."
44: she would do so, she said, with many thanks; but at the bottom of the sack she stuffed a lot of gold and silver, and afterwards she laid a little food on the top of the gold and silver.
45: Then she told the ogre the sack was ready, but he must be sure not to look into it.
53: When he reached the widow's cottage, he threw the sack in through the cottage door, and said— "Here you have meat and drink from your daughter; she doesn't want for anything."
54: So, when the girl had been in the hill a good bit longer, one day a billy-goat fell down the trap-door.
56: you long-bearded beast!" said the Man o' the Hill, who was in an awful rage, and with that he whipped up the goat, and wrung his head off, and threw him down into the cellar.
57: "Oh!" said the girl, "why did you do that?
59: "Well!" said the Man o' the Hill, "you needn't be so down in the mouth about it, I should think, for I can soon put life into the billy-goat again."
60: So saying, he took a flask which hung up against the wall, put the billy-goat's head on his body again, and smeared it with some ointment out of the flask, and he was as well and as lively as ever again.
62: So when she had been some time longer in the hill, she watched for a day when the Man o' the Hill was away, took her eldest sister, and putting her head on her shoulders, smeared her with some of the ointment out of the flask, just as she had seen the Man o' the Hill do with the   and in a trice her sister came to life again.
63: Then the girl stuffed her into a sack, laid a little food over her, and as soon as the Man o' the Hill came home, she said to him— "Dear friend!
64: Now do go home to my mother with a morsel of food again; poor thing!
66: But you must mind and not look into the sack."
68: But just as he was about to untie the sack, the girl who sat inside the sack called out— "The deuce you do!" said the ogre; "then you must have plaguy sharp eyes;" for he thought all the while it was the girl inside the hill who was speaking.
69: So he didn't care so much as to peep into the sack again, but carried it straight to her mother as fast as he could, and when he got to the cottage door he threw it in through the door, and bawled out—
73: Now, when the girl had been in the hill a while longer, she did the very same thing with her other sister.
79: When he got to the cottage door he threw the sack in through the door, and roared out— "Here you have food from your daughter; she wants for nothing."
80: So when the girl had been there a good while longer, the Man o' the Hill made up his mind to go out for the day; then the girl shammed to be sick and sorry, and pouted and fretted.
81: "It’s no use your coming home before twelve o’clock at night," she said, "for I shan't be able to have supper ready before,—I'm so sick and poorly."
82: But when the Man o' the Hill was well out of the house, she stuffed some of her clothes with straw, and stuck up this lass of straw in the corner by the chimney, with a besom in her hand, so that it looked just as if she herself were standing there.
84: So when the clock struck twelve, or just about it, home came the Man o' the Hill, and the first thing he said to the straw-girl was, "Give me something to eat."
91: No! the girl stood just as still as ever; so he flew into a rage, and gave her such a slap in the face, that the straw flew all about the room; but when he saw that, he knew he had been tricked, and began to hunt everywhere; and at last, when he came to the cellar, and found both the girl's sisters missing, he soon saw how the cat jumped, and ran off to the cottage, saying, "I'll soon pay her off!"
92: But when he reached the cottage, the sharp-shooter fired off his piece, and then the Man o' the Hill dared not go into the house, for he thought it was thunder.
93: So he set off home again as fast as he could lay legs to the ground; but what do you think, just as he got to the trap-door, the sun rose and the Man o' the Hill burst.
