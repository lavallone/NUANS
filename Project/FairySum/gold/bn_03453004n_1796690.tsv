0: The white man, leaning with both arms over the roof of the little house in the stern of the boat, said to the steersman-- "We will pass the night in Arsat's clearing.
28: A little house, perched on high piles, appeared black in the distance.
49: Then the boat shoved off, and the white man, standing up, confronted Arsat, who had come out through the low door of his hut.
60: In the dim light of the dwelling he made out on a couch of bamboos a woman stretched on her back under a broad sheet of red cotton cloth.
62: She was in a high fever, and evidently unconscious.
71: He remained silent for a minute, then asked softly-- "Tuan, will she die?"
72: "I fear so," said the white man, sorrowfully.
101: "O Diamelen!"
126: Arsat went on with mournful composure-- "Therefore I shall speak to you of love.
130: "After the time of trouble and war was over and you went away from my country in the pursuit of your desires, which we, men of the islands, cannot understand, I and my brother became again, as we had been before, the sword-bearers of the Ruler.
151: You remember the lady with the veiled face, Tuan, and the fear of our Ruler before her cunning and temper.
178: My brother said gloomily, 'Go and take her; carry her into our boat.'
179: I lifted her in my arms.
214: We passed out of the river; we flew in clear channels amongst the shallows.
245: We made a fire and cooked rice.
247: No sooner had I closed my eyes than I heard her cry of alarm.
250: We knew it at once; it was one of our Rajah's praus.
256: My brother laughed.
258: He spoke to me quickly: 'Run with her along the path.
259: I shall keep them back, for they have no firearms, and landing in the face of a man with a gun is certain death for some.
261: On the other side of that wood there is a fisherman's house--and a canoe.
283: When I looked back I saw that my brother had fallen.
284: He fell and was up again, but the men were closing round him.
294: I heard him cry my name twice; and I heard voices shouting, 'Kill!
297: I heard him calling my name again with a great shriek, as when life is going out together with the voice--and I never turned my head.
316: Then he said quietly-- "Tuan, I loved my brother."
329: The sun had risen.
334: Then he said-- "She burns no more."
340: "I can see nothing," he said half aloud to himself.
348: We are sons of the same mother--and I left him in the midst of enemies; but I am going back now."
349: He drew a long breath and went on in a dreamy tone: "In a little while I shall see clear enough to strike--to strike.
354: The white man got down into his canoe.
359: Arsat had not moved.
360: He stood lonely in the searching sunshine; and he looked beyond the great light of a cloudless day into the darkness of a world of illusions.
