0: Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who had two beautiful boys.
2: The queen never gave birth to a child without sending for the Fairies, and begging them to tell her what would happen to the infant.
3: Her next was a beautiful little girl, so handsome that you could not look on her and not love her.
4: The queen having sumptuously entertained the Fairies who had come to see her, said to them, when they were preparing to depart, "Do not forget your good custom, but tell me what will happen to Rosette" (the name they had given to the little princess).
5: The Fairies replied that they had left their conjuring books at home, and that they would come and tell her another time.
8: At last the principal Fairy said to her, "We fear, Madam, that Rosette will be the cause of some great misfortune to her brothers; that some affair of hers will cost them their lives.
10: They departed, and the queen remained so melancholy that the king could not avoid seeing it in her face.
11: He asked her what was the matter.
26: She therefore told him what the fairies had predicted about little Rosette, and requested him to say if he could think of any remedy for the evil.
29: The minds of their majesties being naturally occupied with this matter entirely, some one informed the queen that in a great forest near the city there was an old hermit who lived in a hollow tree, and who was consulted by people from all parts of the world.
32: When they were near the wood, the queen and her ladies dismounted, out of respect for the hermit, and went on foot to the tree he lived in.
33: He objected to the sight of females, but when he saw it was the queen he said to her, "You are welcome; what is your will with me?"
34: She told him what the Fairies had said about Rosette, and requested his advice.
35: He told her she should put the princess into a tower, out of which she should never be permitted to step.
37: When the king heard this account he ordered a great tower to be built as quickly as possible; he put his daughter into it, and that she might not feel dull, the king, the queen, and her two brothers went to see her every day.
38: The eldest was called the Great Prince, and the younger the Little Prince.
42: At length the king and queen were taken very ill, and died almost on the same day.
45: After the funerals of the king and queen, the dukes and marquises of the kingdom seated the Great Prince on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a magnificent crown on his head, and robes of violet velvet embroidered all over with suns and moons.
48: The King and his brother said to each other, "Now that we are in power, we will take our sister out of the prison in which she has passed so many weary years."
52: The King embraced her, and told her not to cry: that he had come to take her out of the tower, and conduct her to a fine château.
55: When Rosette saw the beautiful garden, all full of flowers, fruits, and fountains, she was so astonished that she could not utter a word, for she had never seen anything of the sort before.
57: Her little dog, named Fretillon, who was as green as a parrot, had but one ear, and danced to perfection, ran before her, bow-wow-wowing with a thousand jumps and capers.
58: Fretillon amused the company amazingly.
59: All on a sudden he ran into a little wood.
60: The princess followed him, and never was any one so astonished as she was at seeing in this wood a great peacock with his tail spread, and looking so beautiful, so beautiful—so beautiful, that she could not take her eyes off him!
61: The king and the prince rejoined her, and inquired what she was amusing herself with.
62: She pointed the peacock out to them, and asked them what it was.
63: They told her it was a bird that was occasionally eaten.
65: she exclaimed, "do they dare to kill such a beautiful bird and eat it?—I declare to you that I will never marry any one but the King of the Peacocks, and when I am queen I will take good care that none shall be eaten."
73: Whilst she was thus keeping the best company, the King and the Prince determined to find the King of the Peacocks, if there was one in the world.
74: They decided that a portrait of the Princess Rosette should be taken, and they had one so finely painted that it did all but speak.
78: Rosette thanked them for the trouble they were taking.
79: She said, "She would carefully govern the kingdom, and that during their absence all her pleasure would consist in contemplating the beautiful peacock and making Fretillon dance."
84: They arrived at the kingdom of Mayflies.
87: He asked one who seemed the most sensible amongst them, if he knew whereabouts he could find the King of the Peacocks.
88: "Sire," said the Mayfly to him, "his kingdom is thirty thousand leagues from this place.
101: When they arrived at the principal city, they perceived it was full of men and women; but that they were dressed in clothes made of peacocks' feathers, and wore a profusion of them everywhere as very fine ornaments.
102: They met the king, who was driving out in a fine little coach of gold and diamonds, drawn by twelve peacocks fully caparisoned.
106: The King and the Prince approached him, and having made their obeisance, said to him, "Sire, we have come from a great distance to show you a beautiful portrait."
108: When the King of the Peacocks had examined it attentively, "I cannot believe," said he, "that there is such a beautiful maid in the world!"
117: She shall lack for nothing at my court; I will love her excessively; but I declare to you that I expect she is as handsome as her portrait, and that if it flatter her in the slightest degree, I will put you to death."
118: "Well, we consent," said the two brothers of Rosette.
119: "You consent!" rejoined the King; "then to prison with you, and there remain until the Princess shall arrive."
122: As the other king and his brother were in prison, they wrote clothes immediately and to come with all speed, as the King of the Peacocks was waiting for her.
124: When she received their letter she was so transported with joy that she thought she should die of it.
125: She told everybody that the King of the Peacocks was found and desired to marry her.
131: They put to sea in a boat, taking with them the bushel of gold crowns, and clothes enough to change their dress twice a-day, for ten years.
133: The nurse asked the boatman, "Are we nearing—are we nearing the kingdom of Peacocks?"
140: He answered, "Yes, yes."
141: And as soon as he had said so, she went to the end of the boat, seated herself beside him, and said to him, "If thou choosest, thou shalt be rich for ever."
145: "Well," said the nurse, "thou must help me then to-night, when the Princess is asleep, to throw her into the sea.
146: As soon as she is drowned I will dress my daughter in the Princess's fine clothes, and we will conduct her to the King of the Peacocks, who will be happy to marry her; and for thy reward, we will load thee with diamonds."
152: She led him into the Princess's cabin; then, without disturbing her, they took her up, with her feather-bed, mattress, sheets, and counterpane, the foster-sister helping them with all her might, and flung the whole into the sea, and the Princess was so fast asleep that she never woke.
166: The nurse had taken great pains to deck out her daughter.
167: She had covered her with Rosette's diamonds, from head to foot, and dressed her in her friend's robes; but despite her finery she looked more ugly than an ape, with greasy black hair, squinting eyes, crooked legs, a great hump in the middle of her back—an ill-tempered slut, continually grumbling.
181: They sent to inform the king that the Princess was approaching.
191: when he did see her, he was nearly dying on the spot!—He flew into the greatest passion in the world.
193: "How!" he cried, "the two scoundrels I hold in prison are bold, indeed, to have made sport of me, and to have proposed to me to marry a baboon like that.
194: They shall die.—Go!
198: Instead of opening their prison and setting them at liberty as they had hoped, the jailor came with some soldiers and made them descend into a cell, perfectly dark, and full of horrid reptiles, where they were up to their necks in water.
204: Three days passed without their hearing a word.
205: At the end of the three days, the King of the Peacocks came and insulted them, through a hole in the wall.
216: He swore that he would not forgive them, and ordered their trial to take place.
220: The Court went in full state to the prison to read the sentence to the prisoners, and they declared that they had not been guilty of falsehood, that their sister was a princess fairer than the day: that there was some mystery which they could not understand, and that they demanded seven days' respite of the execution of their sentence, as in that time their innocence would probably be acknowledged.
222: Whilst all this is passing at Court, we must say a word about the poor Princess Rosette.
223: When day broke, she was greatly astonished, and Fretillon also, to find themselves in the middle of the sea without boat or assistance.
224: She began to cry, and wept so bitterly that all the fishes pitied her.
226: "Assuredly," said she, "I have been thrown into the sea by order of the King of the Peacocks.
227: He has repented his promise to marry me, and to get fairly rid of me has ordered me to be drowned.
239: On the coast there was a good old man who lived all alone in a little hut, which nobody ever came near.
243: All on a sudden he perceived the Princess and Fretillon, who were floating on the water, and the Princess seeing him, stretched out her arms and cried to him, "Good old man, save me, for I am perishing here; I have languished thus for two days!"
250: The old man saw plainly that Rosette was some lady of rank, for the coverlid of her bed was of gold and silver, and her mattress of satin.
254: You will fare badly with me; and if you will take my advice you will let me go and tell the King of the Peacocks that you are here.
256: "Ah," exclaimed Rosette, "he is a wicked creature, and will put me to death; but if you have a little basket, let us tie it round my dog's neck, and it will be very unlucky if he do not bring back something to eat."
258: Fretillon ran to the city, and as there were no saucepans better than the king's, he entered the royal kitchen, took the lid off the largest, adroitly possessed himself of its contents, and returned to the hut.
262: When the King of the Peacocks called for his dinner there was nothing in the saucepan or in the buttery.
272: The next day at dinner and supper time it was exactly the same case, so that the king was without eating or drinking, because, when he was ready to sit down to table, it was discovered that everything had been carried off.
273: His confidant, greatly disturbed, fearing the king would die, concealed himself in a little corner of the kitchen, and kept his eyes constantly on the pot that was boiling.
274: He was much surprised to see a little green dog with one ear enter very softly, take off the cover, and put all the meat into his basket.
275: He followed it to see whither it went.
276: He saw it go out of the city, and followed it to the good old man's.
277: Immediately he returned to tell the king that all his boiled and roast was taken day and night to the hovel of a poor peasant.
279: He ordered the man to be brought before him.
281: They found the old man dining with the Princess upon the king's boiled meat.
282: They seized and bound them with strong cords, and secured Fretillon also.
283: As soon as they arrived at the palace the king was informed of it, who replied, "To-morrow will be the seventh and last day I granted to those impudent impostors.
286: The old man fell on his knees and said he would confess everything.
287: While he was speaking the king gazed on the beautiful Princess, and pitied her tears, but when the good man declared that she was the Princess Rosette who had been thrown into the sea, notwithstanding the king was so weak and faint for want of food, he jumped three times for joy, ran and embraced her, and untied the cords with which she was bound, assuring her that he loved her with all his heart.
293: The joy was so great that the King and the Princess forgave them.
295: The King of the Peacocks, in short, made every sort of amends to the King and his brother, proving his regret at having ill-treated them.
296: The nurse restored to Rosette her rich clothes and her bushel of gold crowns, and the nuptial festivities lasted fifteen days.
