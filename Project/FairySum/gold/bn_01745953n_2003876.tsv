0: A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below.
2: A rope closely encircled his neck.
4: Some loose boards laid upon the ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners'97two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff.
5: At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank, armed.
7: A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as '93support,'94 that is to say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest'97a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body.
12: Midway up the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators'97a single company of infantry in line, at '93parade rest,'94 the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock.
20: The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age.
21: He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter.
30: This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.
31: At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.
38: He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children.
41: Striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith'92s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.
48: What he heard was the ticking of his watch.
50: '93If I could free my hands,'94 he thought, '93I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream.
53: As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man'92s brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant.
54: The sergeant stepped aside.
55: Peyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family.
56: Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause.
61: One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water.
63: While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.
65: They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.
66: The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.
73: The soldier reflected.
75: '93I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge.
76: It is now dry and would burn like tinder.'94
79: An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come.
80: He was a Federal scout.
81: As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead.
91: Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.
92: The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream.
105: The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.
109: He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced.
115: He was now in full possession of his physical senses.
123: He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.
146: The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.
147: The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current.
161: The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men, all were commingled and blurred.
164: In few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream'97the southern bank'97and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies.
173: He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.
174: All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun.
175: The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman'92s road.
178: By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished.
185: Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations.
187: The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which'97once, twice, and again'97he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.
193: Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene'97perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium.
194: He stands at the gate of his own home.
197: As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him.
201: As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon'97then all is darkness and silence!
202: Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.
