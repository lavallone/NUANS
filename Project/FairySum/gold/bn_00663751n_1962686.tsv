3: It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts—as far as I comprehend them myself.
4: They are, succinctly, these: My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and about nine months ago, it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission: no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis.
7: In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the "Bibliotheca Forensica," and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marz) of the Polish versions of "Wallenstein" and "Gargantua."
9: His temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment.
13: For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis.
19: His disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.
20: It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:
22: "You may as well come now. D—— and F—— are agreed that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very nearly.
24: I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber.
32: Doctors D—— and F—— were in attendance.
33: After pressing Valdemar's hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and obtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition.
46: A male and a female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove.
47: I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when the arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance (Mr. Theodore L——l), relieved me from further embarrassment.
50: It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L——l, whether he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.
51: He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, "Yes, I wish to be mesmerized"—adding immediately afterward, "I fear you have deferred it too long."
65: When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar's condition.
66: After a few experiments, they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance.
70: We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when Dr. F—— went away—that is to say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.
76: "M. Valdemar," I said, "are you asleep?"
78: At its third repetition, his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words: "Yes;—asleep now.
82: I questioned the sleep-waker again: "Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?"
83: The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before: "No pain—I am dying."
91: While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep-waker.
92: The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once.
94: The upper lip, at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue.
109: He now said: "Yes;—no;—I have been sleeping—and now—now—I am dead!"
129: From this period until the close of last week—an interval of nearly seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends.
132: It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles—to so much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.
147: As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of "dead! dead!"
148: absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once—within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
149: Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence.
