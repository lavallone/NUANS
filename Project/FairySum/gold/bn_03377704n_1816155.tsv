0: ONCE upon a time there was a king who had a wife, whose name was Silver-tree, and a daughter, whose name was Gold-tree.
1: On a certain day of the days, Gold-tree and Silver-tree went to a glen, where there was a well, and in it there was a trout.
2: Said Silver-tree, "Troutie, bonny little fellow, am not I the most beautiful queen in the world?"
3: "Oh! indeed you are not."
4: "Who then?"
5: "Why, Gold-tree, your daughter."
6: Silver-tree went home, blind with rage.
7: She lay down on the bed, and vowed she would never be well until she could get the heart and the liver of Gold-tree, her daughter, to eat.
13: Now it happened about this time that the son of a great king had come from abroad to ask Gold-tree for marrying.
14: The king now agreed to this, and they went abroad.
15: The king then went and sent his lads to the hunting-hill for a he-goat, and he gave its heart and its liver to his wife to eat; and she rose well and healthy.
16: A year after this Silver-tree went to the glen, where there was the well in which there was the trout.
17: "Troutie, bonny little fellow," said she, "am not I the most beautiful queen in the world?"
18: "Oh! indeed you are not."
19: "Who then?"
20: "Why, Gold-tree, your daughter."
21: "Oh! well, it is long since she was living.
22: It is a year since I ate her heart and liver."
23: "Oh! indeed she is not dead.
24: She is married to a great prince abroad."
25: Silver-tree went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in order, and said, "I am going to see my dear Gold-tree, for it is so long since I saw her."
32: This is how it was done; and when Silver-tree came ashore, she began to cry out: "Come to meet your own mother, when she comes to see you," Gold-tree said that she could not, that she was locked in the room, and that she could not get out of it.
33: "Will you not put out," said Silver-tree, "your little finger through the keyhole, so that your own mother may give a kiss to it?"
34: She put out her little finger, and Silver-tree went and put a poisoned stab in it, and Gold-tree fell dead.
35: When the prince came home, and found Gold-tree dead, he was in great sorrow, and when he saw how beautiful she was, he did not bury her at all, but he locked her in a room where nobody would get near her.
37: On a certain day of the days he forgot to take the key with him, and the second wife got into the room.
40: She took the stab out, and Gold-tree rose alive, as beautiful as she was ever.
48: At the end of the year, Silver-tree went to the glen, where there was the well, in which there was the trout.
49: "Troutie, bonny little fellow," said she, "am not I the most beautiful queen in the world?"
50: "Oh! indeed you are not."
51: "Who then?"
52: "Why, Gold-tree, your daughter."
53: "Oh! well, she is not alive.
54: It is a year since I put the poisoned stab into her finger."
55: "Oh! indeed she is not dead at all, at all."
56: Silver-tree went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in order, for that she was going to see her dear Gold-tree, as it was so long since she saw her.
64: "Come down, Gold-tree, love," said she, "for your own mother has come to you with a precious drink."
65: "It is a custom in this country," said the second wife, "that the person who offers a drink takes a draught out of it first."
66: Silver-tree put her mouth to it, and the second wife went and struck it so that some of it went down her throat, and she fell dead.
68: The prince and his two wives were long alive after this, pleased and peaceful.
