0: ONE fine evening a young princess went into a wood, and sat down by the side of a cool spring of water.
1: She had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite play-thing, and she amused herself with tossing it into the air and catching it again as it fell.
5: if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and every thing that I have in the world."
6: Whilst she was speaking a frog put its head out of the water and said, "Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?"
9: The frog said, "I want not your pearls and jewels and fine clothes; but if you will love me and let me live with you, and eat from your little golden plate, and sleep upon your little bed, I will bring you your ball again."
12: So she said to the frog, "Well, if you will bring me my ball, I promise to do all you require."
13: Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the ground.
29: The king said to the young princess, "As you have made a promise, you must keep it, so go and let him in."
30: She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and came up close to the table.
31: "Pray lift me upon a chair," said he to the princess, "and let me sit next to you."
32: As soon as she had done this, the frog said, "Put your plate closer to me that I may eat out of it."
33: This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said " Now I am tired; carry me up stairs and put me into your little bed."
34: And the princess took him up in her hand and put him upon the pillow of her own little bed, where he slept all night along.
36: "Now," thought the princess, "he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more."
37: But she was mistaken; for when night came again, she heard the same tapping at the door, and when she opened it, the frog came in and slept upon her pillow as before till the morning broke: and the third night he did the same; but when the princess awoke on the following morning, she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes that ever were seen, and standing at the head of her bed.
38: He told he that he had been enchanted by a malicious fairy, who had changed him into the form of a frog, in which he was fated to remain till some princess should take him out of the spring and let him sleep upon her bed for three nights.
40: The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in giving her consent; and as they spoke a splendid carriage drove up with eight beautiful horses decked with plumes of feathers and golden harness, and behind rode the prince's servant, the faithful Henry, who had bewailed the misfortune of his dear master so long and bitterly that his heart had well-nigh burst.
