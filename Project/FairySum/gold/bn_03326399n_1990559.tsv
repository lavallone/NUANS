0: Once upon a time there was a king's daughter, who was so handsome, there was nothing in the world to be compared with her for beauty, and she was called the Fair with Golden Hair: because her locks were like the finest gold, marvellously bright, and falling all in ringlets to her feet.
3: There was a young king amongst her neighbours, who was unmarried, very handsome, and very rich.
4: When he heard all that was said about the Fair with Golden Hair, although he had never seen her, he felt so deeply in love with her, that he could neither eat nor drink, and therefore resolved to send an ambassador to ask her hand in marriage.
7: While the workmen were hard at work, the ambassador arrived at the Fair one's court and delivered his little message; but whether she was that day out of temper, or that the compliment was not agreeable to her, she answered the ambassador, that she thanked the king, but had no inclination to marry.
8: The ambassador quitted the court of the princess very low-spirited at not being able to bring her with him.
14: There was a youth at court who was as beautiful as the sun, and had the finest figure in the kingdom.
15: On account of his graceful manners and his intelligence he was called Avenant.
17: Avenant was in company with some persons who were talking of the return of the ambassador, and saying he had done no good.
18: "If the king had sent me to the Fair with Golden Hair," said he to them carelessly, "I am certain she would have returned with me."
19: These mischief-makers went immediately to the king, and said, "Sire, you know not what Avenant asserts,—That if you had sent him to the Fair with Golden Hair he would have brought her back with him.
21: He pretends that he is handsomer than you, and that she would have been so fond of him that she would have followed him anywhere."
22: At this the king flew into a rage—a rage so terrible, that he was quite beside himself.
25: Go!—fling him into the great tower, and let him starve to death!"
26: The royal guards hastened in search of Avenant, who had quite forgotten what he had said.
27: They dragged him to prison, inflicting a thousand injuries upon him.
29: One day, when he was quite exhausted, he exclaimed, with a heavy sigh, "What does the king complain of?
31: The king by chance passed close by the tower, and hearing the voice of one he had loved so dearly, he stopped to listen, notwithstanding those who were with him, who hated Avenant, and said to the king, "What interests you, Sire?—Do you not know he is a rogue?"
32: The king replied, "Leave me alone; I would hear what he has to say."
33: Having listened to his complaints, the tears stood in his eyes: he opened the door of the tower and called to the prisoner.
34: Avenant came, and knelt before him in deep sorrow, and kissed his feet.
35: "What have I done, Sire, that I am thus severely treated?"
36: "Thou hast made game of me, and of my ambassador," answered the king.
37: "Thou hast boasted, that if I had sent thee to the Fair with Golden Hair, thou wouldst certainly have brought her back with thee."
38: "It is true, Sire," rejoined Avenant, "that I should have so impressed her with the sense of your majesty's high qualities, that I feel persuaded she could not have refused you; and in saying that, Sire, I uttered nothing that could be disagreeable to you."
39: The king saw clearly that Avenant was innocent.
41: After giving him an excellent supper he called him into his cabinet and said to him: "Avenant, I still love the Fair with Golden Hair; her refusal has not discouraged me: but I know not what course to take to induce her to marry me.
42: I am tempted to send thee to her to see if thou couldst succeed."
43: Avenant replied that he was ready to obey him in everything, and that he would set out the next day.
47: It was on a Monday morning that he took leave of the king and of his friends to proceed on his embassy, quite alone and without pomp or noise.
49: He had a writing-case in his pocket, and when a happy idea occurred to him for his introductory address, he alighted from his steed and seated himself under the trees to commit it to paper, so that he might not forget anything.
76: He was so eager to reach the end of it, that he lost no time in repairing to the palace of the Fair with Golden Hair.
80: He dressed himself in a suit of brocade, with a plume of carnation and white feathers; combed and powdered himself, washed his face, put a richly embroidered scarf round his neck, with a little basket, and in it a beautiful little dog which he had bought as he came through Bologna.
84: Avenant was so handsome, so amiable, and did everything with so much grace, that when he presented himself at the palace gate, the guards saluted him most respectfully, and they ran to inform the Fair with Golden Hair, that Avenant, ambassador from the king, her nearest neighbour, requested to be presented to her.
96: "Gentle Avenant," she replied, "the arguments you have adduced are all of them exceedingly good, and I assure you I should be very happy to favour you more than another, but you must know that about a month ago I was walking by the river side, with all my ladies in waiting, and in pulling off my glove in order to take some refreshment that was served me I drew from my finger a ring, which unfortunately fell into the stream.
99: I have made a vow never to listen to any offers of marriage, if the ambassador, who proposes the husband, does not restore to me my ring.
101: Avenant was much surprised at this answer: he made the princess a low bow, and begged her to accept the little dog, the basket, and the scarf; but she replied that she would receive no presents, and bade him go and reflect on what she had said to him.
102: When he returned to his lodgings, he went to bed without eating any supper, and his little dog, whose name was Cabriolle, would take none himself, and went and laid down beside his master.
110: Cabriolle, as soon as he saw daybreak, frisked about so that he waked Avenant, and said to him, "Dress yourself, master, and let us go out."
111: Avenant was quite willing; he arose, dressed, and descended into the garden, and from the garden strayed mechanically towards the river, on the banks of which he strolled with his hat pulled over his eyes, and his arms folded, thinking only of taking his departure, when suddenly he heard himself called by his name—"Avenant!
116: "Who calls me?" he asked.
117: Cabriolle, who was very little and was looking close down into the water, replied, "Never trust me if it be not a golden carp that I see here."
124: Here, dear Avenant, is the ring of the Fair with Golden Hair.
125: Avenant stooped and took the ring out of my friend the carp's mouth, whom he thanked a thousand times.
127: The princess was informed that Avenant requested to see her.
130: Avenant was introduced, and presented her with the ring, saying, "Madam, I have obeyed your commands.
131: Will it please you to accept the king my master for your husband?"
135: "As you are so obliging," continued she, "you must do me another service, without which I never will be married.
136: There is a prince not far from here, named Galifron, who has taken it into his head he will make me his wife.
139: I sent word to him that I did not wish to marry, and that he must excuse me, but he has never ceased to persecute me.
140: He kills all my subjects, and before anything can be done you must fight him and bring me his head."
141: Avenant was a little astounded at this proposition; he mused for a few minutes upon it, and then answered, "Well, Madam, I will fight Galifron; I believe I shall be conquered, but I will die as becomes a brave man."
144: He withdrew to seek for weapons and everything else he might require.
163: When Galifron heard these words, he looked about him in every direction, and caught sight of Avenant, who, sword in hand, uttered several taunts to provoke him.
168: Avenant quickly cut off his head, quite transported with joy at his good fortune; and the crow, who had perched itself on the nearest tree, said to him: "I have not forgotten the service you rendered me in killing the eagle which pursued me.
175: "Madam," said Avenant to the princess, "your enemy is dead: I trust you will no longer refuse the king my master."
176: "Ah! pardon me," said the Fair with Golden Hair; "but, indeed, I must refuse him, unless you can find means, before my departure, to bring me some water from the Gloomy Grotto.
213: He went straight to the palace and presented the phial to the Fair with Golden Hair, who had no longer an excuse to make.
214: She thanked Avenant, gave orders for everything to be got ready for her departure, and finally set out with him on their journey.
218: The marriage was celebrated with such great rejoicings, that folks could talk of nothing else.
219: But the Fair with Golden Hair, who secretly loved Avenant, was never happy when he was out of her sight, and was always praising him.
225: The envious courtiers who heard the queen express herself thus, said to the king, "You are not jealous, and yet you have good cause to be so.
226: The queen is so deeply in love with Avenant, that she can neither eat nor drink.
229: "That's quite true," said the king, "now I think of it.
230: Let him be put in the tower, with irons on his hands and feet."
237: The king took it into his head, that perhaps she did not think him handsome enough.
238: He longed to wash his face with the water of beauty, in hopes that the queen would then feel more affection for him.
243: So it happened one evening that the king took down the phial which he fancied contained the water of beauty, and rubbing the contents well over his face, he fell into a profound slumber and expired.
244: The little dog, Cabriolle, was the first to hear the news of the king's death, and ran with it to Avenant, who begged him to go and find the Fair with Golden Hair, and remind her of the poor prisoner.
245: Cabriolle slipped quietly through the crowd, for there was great confusion at court, in consequence of the king's death, and said to the queen, "Madam, do not forget poor Avenant."
246: She immediately recalled to her mind all that he had suffered on her account, and his extreme fidelity.
247: She left the palace without speaking to any one, and went directly to the tower, where with her own hands she took the irons off the hands and feet of Avenant, and putting a crown of gold upon his head, and a royal mantle over his shoulders, she said, "Come, charming Avenant, I make you king, and take you for my husband."
