0: Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who had two beautiful boys.
3: Her next was a beautiful little girl, so handsome that you could not look on her and not love her.
4: The queen having sumptuously entertained the Fairies who had come to see her, said to them, when they were preparing to depart, "Do not forget your good custom, but tell me what will happen to Rosette" (the name they had given to the little princess).
8: At last the principal Fairy said to her, "We fear, Madam, that Rosette will be the cause of some great misfortune to her brothers; that some affair of hers will cost them their lives.
10: They departed, and the queen remained so melancholy that the king could not avoid seeing it in her face.
29: The minds of their majesties being naturally occupied with this matter entirely, some one informed the queen that in a great forest near the city there was an old hermit who lived in a hollow tree, and who was consulted by people from all parts of the world.
32: When they were near the wood, the queen and her ladies dismounted, out of respect for the hermit, and went on foot to the tree he lived in.
34: She told him what the Fairies had said about Rosette, and requested his advice.
35: He told her she should put the princess into a tower, out of which she should never be permitted to step.
37: When the king heard this account he ordered a great tower to be built as quickly as possible; he put his daughter into it, and that she might not feel dull, the king, the queen, and her two brothers went to see her every day.
38: The eldest was called the Great Prince, and the younger the Little Prince.
42: At length the king and queen were taken very ill, and died almost on the same day.
45: After the funerals of the king and queen, the dukes and marquises of the kingdom seated the Great Prince on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a magnificent crown on his head, and robes of violet velvet embroidered all over with suns and moons.
46: The whole court then shouted three times, "Long live the King!"
48: The King and his brother said to each other, "Now that we are in power, we will take our sister out of the prison in which she has passed so many weary years."
52: The King embraced her, and told her not to cry: that he had come to take her out of the tower, and conduct her to a fine château.
55: When Rosette saw the beautiful garden, all full of flowers, fruits, and fountains, she was so astonished that she could not utter a word, for she had never seen anything of the sort before.
57: Her little dog, named Fretillon, who was as green as a parrot, had but one ear, and danced to perfection, ran before her, bow-wow-wowing with a thousand jumps and capers.
59: All on a sudden he ran into a little wood.
60: The princess followed him, and never was any one so astonished as she was at seeing in this wood a great peacock with his tail spread, and looking so beautiful, so beautiful—so beautiful, that she could not take her eyes off him!
61: The king and the prince rejoined her, and inquired what she was amusing herself with.
62: She pointed the peacock out to them, and asked them what it was.
63: They told her it was a bird that was occasionally eaten.
64: "What!"
65: she exclaimed, "do they dare to kill such a beautiful bird and eat it?—I declare to you that I will never marry any one but the King of the Peacocks, and when I am queen I will take good care that none shall be eaten."
75: They then said to her, "Since you will not marry any one but the King of the Peacocks, we are about to set out together in search of him throughout the world.
76: If we find him we shall be very happy.
77: Take care of the kingdom till we return."
83: They travelled on still further, and at last went so far—so far, that nobody has ever been such a distance.
84: They arrived at the kingdom of Mayflies.
93: They saw all the sights of the kingdom, admiring its curiosities, the smallest leaf on any tree in it being worth a pistole; after which they set out again to finish their journey; and, as they had learned the way, they were not long about it.
101: When they arrived at the principal city, they perceived it was full of men and women; but that they were dressed in clothes made of peacocks' feathers, and wore a profusion of them everywhere as very fine ornaments.
102: They met the king, who was driving out in a fine little coach of gold and diamonds, drawn by twelve peacocks fully caparisoned.
103: This King of the Peacocks was so handsome—so handsome—that the King and the Prince were charmed with him.
106: The King and the Prince approached him, and having made their obeisance, said to him, "Sire, we have come from a great distance to show you a beautiful portrait."
107: They took out of their portmanteau the grand portrait of Rosette.
108: When the King of the Peacocks had examined it attentively, "I cannot believe," said he, "that there is such a beautiful maid in the world!"
111: "Sire," said the Prince, "there is my brother, who is a king as well as you.
112: He is styled the King, and I am called the Prince.
113: Our sister, of whom this is the portrait, is the Princess Rosette.
114: We come to ask you if you will espouse her.
115: She is beautiful and very virtuous, and we will give her a bushel of golden crowns."
116: "Yes, truly," said the king, "I will marry her with all my heart.
117: She shall lack for nothing at my court; I will love her excessively; but I declare to you that I expect she is as handsome as her portrait, and that if it flatter her in the slightest degree, I will put you to death."
118: "Well, we consent," said the two brothers of Rosette.
119: "You consent!" rejoined the King; "then to prison with you, and there remain until the Princess shall arrive."
122: As the other king and his brother were in prison, they wrote clothes immediately and to come with all speed, as the King of the Peacocks was waiting for her.
124: When she received their letter she was so transported with joy that she thought she should die of it.
125: She told everybody that the King of the Peacocks was found and desired to marry her.
130: She begged them to preserve her peacock, and would take nobody with her but her nurse, her foster-sister, and her little green dog Fretillon.
131: They put to sea in a boat, taking with them the bushel of gold crowns, and clothes enough to change their dress twice a-day, for ten years.
133: The nurse asked the boatman, "Are we nearing—are we nearing the kingdom of Peacocks?"
140: He answered, "Yes, yes."
141: And as soon as he had said so, she went to the end of the boat, seated herself beside him, and said to him, "If thou choosest, thou shalt be rich for ever."
142: He answered, "I should like it much."
145: "Well," said the nurse, "thou must help me then to-night, when the Princess is asleep, to throw her into the sea.
146: As soon as she is drowned I will dress my daughter in the Princess's fine clothes, and we will conduct her to the King of the Peacocks, who will be happy to marry her; and for thy reward, we will load thee with diamonds."
151: Rosette was sleeping soundly, when the wicked nurse, who was wide awake, went to fetch the boatman.
152: She led him into the Princess's cabin; then, without disturbing her, they took her up, with her feather-bed, mattress, sheets, and counterpane, the foster-sister helping them with all her might, and flung the whole into the sea, and the Princess was so fast asleep that she never woke.
153: But, by good fortune, the feather-bed was stuffed with Phœnix feathers, which are very rare, and possess the property of never sinking in the water, so that she floated on her bed just as if she had been in a boat.
159: The wicked nurse and the boatman heard him a long way off, and said, "There is that little rogue of a dog drinking with his mistress to our good health.
160: Let us make haste to land;"—for they were just in sight of the city of the King of the Peacocks.
161: His majesty had sent down to the beach a hundred coaches drawn by all sorts of rare animals.
166: The nurse had taken great pains to deck out her daughter.
167: She had covered her with Rosette's diamonds, from head to foot, and dressed her in her friend's robes; but despite her finery she looked more ugly than an ape, with greasy black hair, squinting eyes, crooked legs, a great hump in the middle of her back—an ill-tempered slut, continually grumbling.
173: She sat in her coach like a queen: but all the peacocks that had perched themselves in the trees to salute her as she passed, and had resolved to cry, "Long live the beautiful Queen Rosette," when they perceived her to be such a horrible fright, cried, "Fie!
174: fie!
175: how ugly she is!"
181: They sent to inform the king that the Princess was approaching.
189: The King of the Peacocks was exceedingly impatient to see his dear Rosette.
190: Mercy!
191: when he did see her, he was nearly dying on the spot!—He flew into the greatest passion in the world.
193: "How!" he cried, "the two scoundrels I hold in prison are bold, indeed, to have made sport of me, and to have proposed to me to marry a baboon like that.
194: They shall die.—Go!
195: Lock up instantly that impertinent girl, her nurse, and the fellow who brought them hither.
196: Fling them into the lowest dungeon of my great tower."
204: Three days passed without their hearing a word.
205: At the end of the three days, the King of the Peacocks came and insulted them, through a hole in the wall.
216: He swore that he would not forgive them, and ordered their trial to take place.
219: Consequently they were condemned to lose their heads, as false traitors, who had promised to give the king a beautiful princess in marriage, and had only offered to him an ugly country wench.
220: The Court went in full state to the prison to read the sentence to the prisoners, and they declared that they had not been guilty of falsehood, that their sister was a princess fairer than the day: that there was some mystery which they could not understand, and that they demanded seven days' respite of the execution of their sentence, as in that time their innocence would probably be acknowledged.
221: The King of the Peacocks, who was greatly incensed, was very loth to grant them this favour: but eventually he consented.
222: Whilst all this is passing at Court, we must say a word about the poor Princess Rosette.
223: When day broke, she was greatly astonished, and Fretillon also, to find themselves in the middle of the sea without boat or assistance.
226: "Assuredly," said she, "I have been thrown into the sea by order of the King of the Peacocks.
227: He has repented his promise to marry me, and to get fairly rid of me has ordered me to be drowned.
228: What an extraordinary man!"
239: On the coast there was a good old man who lived all alone in a little hut, which nobody ever came near.
241: When he heard Fretillon bark, he was quite surprised, for dogs seldom passed that way.
243: All on a sudden he perceived the Princess and Fretillon, who were floating on the water, and the Princess seeing him, stretched out her arms and cried to him, "Good old man, save me, for I am perishing here; I have languished thus for two days!"
244: When he heard her speak so sorrowfully, he had great compassion for her, and re-entered his dwelling to get a long boathook.
246: At length he contrived to pull the bed to the shore.
247: Rosette and Fretillon were vastly glad to be upon dry land.
250: The old man saw plainly that Rosette was some lady of rank, for the coverlid of her bed was of gold and silver, and her mattress of satin.
253: "What shall we do, my daughter?" said the old man to her: "you are so great a princess, accustomed to dainties, and I have nothing to give you but black bread and radishes.
254: You will fare badly with me; and if you will take my advice you will let me go and tell the King of the Peacocks that you are here.
255: I am sure that if he had seen you he would have married you."
256: "Ah," exclaimed Rosette, "he is a wicked creature, and will put me to death; but if you have a little basket, let us tie it round my dog's neck, and it will be very unlucky if he do not bring back something to eat."
258: Fretillon ran to the city, and as there were no saucepans better than the king's, he entered the royal kitchen, took the lid off the largest, adroitly possessed himself of its contents, and returned to the hut.
259: Rosette said to him, "Go back to the buttery and bring me the best of everything."
260: Fretillon returned to the buttery and filled his basket with white bread, muscadel wine, and all sorts of fruits and preserves.
262: When the King of the Peacocks called for his dinner there was nothing in the saucepan or in the buttery.
266: When evening arrived, the Princess said to Fretillon, "Go to the city, enter the best kitchen, and bring me some nice roast meat."
268: He brought his basket home, quite full, to the Princess.
269: She sent him back immediately to the buttery, and he returned with all the royal preserves and sweetmeats.
270: The king, who had not dined, being very hungry, desired to sup early; but there was nothing to set before him.
272: The next day at dinner and supper time it was exactly the same case, so that the king was without eating or drinking, because, when he was ready to sit down to table, it was discovered that everything had been carried off.
273: His confidant, greatly disturbed, fearing the king would die, concealed himself in a little corner of the kitchen, and kept his eyes constantly on the pot that was boiling.
274: He was much surprised to see a little green dog with one ear enter very softly, take off the cover, and put all the meat into his basket.
275: He followed it to see whither it went.
276: He saw it go out of the city, and followed it to the good old man's.
277: Immediately he returned to tell the king that all his boiled and roast was taken day and night to the hovel of a poor peasant.
279: He ordered the man to be brought before him.
281: They found the old man dining with the Princess upon the king's boiled meat.
283: As soon as they arrived at the palace the king was informed of it, who replied, "To-morrow will be the seventh and last day I granted to those impudent impostors.
284: They shall die with these thieves who have stolen my dinner."
287: While he was speaking the king gazed on the beautiful Princess, and pitied her tears, but when the good man declared that she was the Princess Rosette who had been thrown into the sea, notwithstanding the king was so weak and faint for want of food, he jumped three times for joy, ran and embraced her, and untied the cords with which she was bound, assuring her that he loved her with all his heart.
295: The King of the Peacocks, in short, made every sort of amends to the King and his brother, proving his regret at having ill-treated them.
296: The nurse restored to Rosette her rich clothes and her bushel of gold crowns, and the nuptial festivities lasted fifteen days.
