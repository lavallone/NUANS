1: The old banker was pacing from corner to corner of his study, recalling to his mind the party he gave in the autumn fifteen years ago.
10: Who is the more humane executioner, one who kills you in a few seconds or one who draws the life out of you incessantly, for years?"
14: Among the company was a lawyer, a young man of about twenty-five.
15: On being asked his opinion, he said:  "Capital punishment and life-imprisonment are equally immoral; but if I were offered the choice between them, I would certainly choose the second.
18: The banker who was then younger and more nervous suddenly lost his temper, banged his fist on the table, and turning to the young lawyer, cried out:
20: I bet you two millions you wouldn't stick in a cell even for five years."
21: "If that's serious," replied the lawyer, "then I bet I'll stay not five but fifteen."
43: It was decided that the lawyer must undergo his imprisonment under the strictest observation, in a garden-wing of the banker's house.
44: It was agreed that during the period he would be deprived of the right to cross the threshold, to see living people, to hear human voices, and to receive letters and newspapers.
46: By the agreement he could communicate, but only in silence, with the outside world through a little window specially constructed for this purpose.
65: In the space of four years about six hundred volumes were bought at his request.
78: During the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an extraordinary amount, quite haphazard.
82: The banker recalled all this, and thought: "To-morrow at twelve o'clock he receives his freedom.
86: Fifteen years before he had too many millions to count, but now he was afraid to ask himself which he had more of, money or debts.
88: "That cursed bet," murmured the old man clutching his head in despair . . .
94: The only escape from bankruptcy and disgraceâ€”is that the man should die."
98: Trying to make no sound, he took out of his safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.
112: In the prisoner's room a candle was burning dim.
128: On the table, before his bended head, lay a sheet of paper on which something was written in a tiny hand.
129: "Poor devil," thought the banker, "he's asleep and probably seeing millions in his dreams.
130: I have only to take and throw this half-dead thing on the bed, smother him a moment with the pillow, and the most careful examination will find no trace of unnatural death.
132: The banker took the sheet from the table and read:  "To-morrow at twelve o'clock midnight, I shall obtain my freedom and the right to mix with people.
152: "That I may show you in deed my contempt for that by which you live, I waive the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise, and which I now despise.
153: That I may deprive myself of my right to them, I shall come out from here five minutes before the stipulated term, and thus shall violate the agreement."
154: When he had read, the banker put the sheet on the table, kissed the head of the strange man, and began to weep.
158: The next morning the poor watchman came running to him and told him that they had seen the man who lived in the wing climbing through the window into the garden.
161: To avoid unnecessary rumours he took the paper with the renunciation from the table and, on his return, locked it in his safe.
