0: A POOR widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red.
1: She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red.
2: Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do.
3: The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand-in-hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said: ‘We will never desert each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘No, not as long as we live;’ and the mother added: ‘Whatever one gets she shall share with the other.’
15: One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance.
17: Rose-red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the door.
18: Rose-red screamed aloud
20: But the bear began to speak, and said: ‘Don’t be afraid: I won’t hurt you.
21: I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.’
22: ‘My poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care you don’t burn your fur.’
25: The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry.
27: The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life.
28: They tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he growled they only laughed.
32: When it was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: ‘You can lie there on the hearth, in heaven’s name; it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet.’
33: As soon as day dawned the children let him out, and he trotted over the snow into the wood.
34: From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance.
35: When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and not return again the whole summer.’
36: ‘Where are going to, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white.
37: ‘I must go to the wood and prootect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs.
40: A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots.
41: They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn’t distinguish.
42: When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long.
43: The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain, and didn’t seem to know what he was to do.
51: The children did all in their power, but they couldn’t get the beard out; it was wedged in far too firmly.
52: ‘I will run and fetch somebody,’ said Rose-red.
53: ‘Crazy blockheads!’ snapped the dwarf; ‘what’s the good of calling anyone else?
54: you’re already two too many for me.
55: Does nothing better occur to you than that?’ ‘Don’t be so impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I’ll see you get help;’ and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut the end off his beard.
56: As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: ‘Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!’
58: Shortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish.
60: They ran forward and recognised their old friend the dwarf.
64: The little man had been sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line; and when immediately afterwards a big fish bit, the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper fin, and dragged the dwarf towards him.
66: The girls came up just at the right moment, held him firm, and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in a hopeless muddle.
67: Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard, by which a small part of it was sacrificed.
68: When the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: ‘Do you call that manners, you toadstools!
74: It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons.
76: While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them.
78: They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off.
79: The tender-hearted children seized a hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey.
80: When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice: ‘Couldn’t you have treated me more carefully?
84: On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour.
86: ‘What are you standing there gaping for?’ screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became scarlet with rage.
87: He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood.
88: The dwarf jumped up in a great fright, but he hadn’t time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already close to him.
89: Then he cried in terror: ‘Dear Mr. Bear, spare me!
93: what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me?
95: There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven’s sake.’
96: But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.
97: The girls had run away, but the bear called after them: ‘Snow white and Rose-red, don’t be afraid; wait, and I’ll come with you.’
98: Then they recognised his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all dressed in gold.
99: ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free.
101: Snow-white married him, and Rose-red his brother, and they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them.
