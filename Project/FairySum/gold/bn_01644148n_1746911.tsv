0: You needn't think I'm crazy, Eliot—plenty of others have queerer prejudices than this.
9: Maybe you ought to, anyhow, for you kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard I'd begun to cut the Art Club and keep away from Pickman.
10: Now that he's disappeared I go round to the club once in a while, but my nerves aren't what they were.
11: No, I don't know what's become of Pickman, and I don't like to guess.
12: You might have surmised I had some inside information when I dropped him—and that's why I don't want to think where he's gone.
13: Let the police find what they can—it won't be much, judging from the fact that they don't know yet of the old North End place he hired under the name of Peters.
19: There was something there—and now I can't use the subway or (and you may as well have your laugh at this, too) go down into cellars any more.
22: Boston never had a greater painter than Richard Upton Pickman.
23: I said it at first and I say it still, and I never swerved an inch, either, when he showed that 'Ghoul Feeding'.
24: That, you remember, was when Minot cut him.
55: As you know, the club wouldn't exhibit it, and the Museum of Fine Arts wouldn't accept it as a gift; and I can add that nobody would buy it, so Pickman had it right in his house till he went.
57: I got into the habit of calling on Pickman quite often, especially after I began making notes for a monograph on weird art.
61: My hero-worship, coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him, made him get very confidential with me; and one evening he hinted that if I were fairly close-mouthed and none too squeamish, he might show me something rather unusual—something a bit stronger than anything he had in the house.
94: What if I told you that I've got another studio up there, where I can catch the night-spirit of antique horror and paint things that I couldn't even think of in Newbury Street?
95: Naturally I don't tell those cursed old maids at the club—with Reid, damn him, whispering even as it is that I'm a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution.
102: I paint in the cellar, where the inspiration is thickest, but I've other rooms furnished on the ground floor.
103: A Sicilian owns it, and I've hired it under the name of Peters.
104: 'Now, if you're game, I'll take you there tonight.
108: Well, Eliot, there wasn't much for me to do after that harangue but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight.
114: Not long after this Pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian ten-panelled door that looked damnably worm-eaten.
115: Unlocking it, he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once splendid dark-oak panelling—simple, of course, but thrillingly suggestive of the times of Andros and Phipps and the Witchcraft.
116: Then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to make myself at home.
117: Now, Eliot, I'm what the man in the street would call fairly 'hard-boiled,' but I'll confess that what I saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn.
118: They were his pictures, you know—the ones he couldn't paint or even show in Newbury Street—and he was right when he said he had 'let himself go.'
120: There's no use in my trying to tell you what they were like, because the awful, the blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify.
153: By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to see his 'modern studies.'
156: I'm middle-aged and decently sophisticated, and I guess you saw enough of me in France to know I'm not easily knocked out.
157: Remember, too, that I'd just about recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial New England into a kind of annex of hell.
158: Well, in spite of all this, that next room forced a real scream out of me, and I had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over.
180: Pickman was in every sense—in conception and in execution—a thorough, painstaking, and almost scientific realist.
181: My host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio, and I braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases.
182: As we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he fumed his flash-light to a corner of the large open space at hand, revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor.
186: Thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if Pickman's wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size, provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio.
188: The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs, and showed the painstaking methods of the artist.
193: There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half-finished monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream—the second I had emitted that night.
198: It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy.
204: The monster was there—it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared—and I knew that only a suspension of Nature's laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a model—without some glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the Fiend has ever had.
205: Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled up—probably, I thought, a photograph from which Pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance.
206: I reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly I saw Pickman start as if shot.
207: He had been listening with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar, and now he seemed struck with a fright which, though not comparable to my own, had in it more of the physical than of the spiritual.
208: He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence, then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him.
217: After that followed a sharp grating noise, a shouted gibberish from Pickman, and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver, fired spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect.
220: Pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon, cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient well.
225: Well, Eliot, that was the end of the night's adventure.
232: I never spoke to him again.
237: No—it wasn't the paintings I saw in that place; though I'll swear they were enough to get him ostracised in nine-tenths of the homes and clubs of Boston, and I guess you won't wonder now why I have to steer clear of subways and cellars.
238: It was—something I found in my coat the next morning.
239: You know, the curled-up paper tacked to the frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster.
251: You know how damned lifelike Pickman's paintings were—how we all wondered where he got those faces.
252: Well—that paper wasn't a photograph of any background, after all.
253: What it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas.
255: But by God, Eliot, it was a photograph from life!
