0: Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress.
4: One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance.
5: They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to every one who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.
6: “These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!”
7: thought the Emperor.
10: And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly.
11: So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all.
16: “I will send my faithful old minister, to the weavers,” said the Emperor at last, after some deliberation, “he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is.”
17: So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might, at their empty looms.
19: “I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.”
20: However, he did not express his thoughts aloud.
35: The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready.
36: It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.
41: And accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns.
44: And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom.
45: Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of the Emperor’s approach, went on working more diligently than ever; although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.
51: “How is this?” said the Emperor to himself, “I can see nothing!
56: And he smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much.
63: The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor’s new suit.
65: “See!” cried they, at last, “the Emperor’s new clothes are ready!”
72: The Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side, before the looking glass.
83: So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, “Oh! how beautiful are our Emperor’s new clothes!
87: “But the Emperor has nothing at all on!” said a little child.
90: “But he has nothing at all on!”
91: at last cried out all the people.
92: The Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he thought the procession must go on now!
