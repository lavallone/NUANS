9: From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition.
11: I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets.
16: I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own.
18: We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.
19: This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree.
22: Pluto—this was the cat's name—was my favorite pet and playmate.
23: I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house.
26: I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others.
32: But my disease grew upon me—for what disease is like alcohol?—and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish—even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.
33: One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence.
34: I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth.
38: I took from my waistcoat pocket a pen-knife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket!
42: In the meantime the cat slowly recovered.
44: He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach.
45: I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me.
46: But this feeling soon gave place to irritation.
47: And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of Perverseness.
54: One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree—hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart—hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and be  I felt it had given me no reason of offence;—hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin—a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it—if such a thing were possible—even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.
55: On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire.
58: It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration.
63: On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins.
64: The walls, with one exception, had fallen in.
65: This exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed.
70: I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat.
72: There was a rope about the animal's neck.
73: When I first beheld this apparition—for I could scarcely regard it as less—my wonder and my terror were extreme.
74: But at length reflection came to my aid.
76: Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd—by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my chamber.
80: For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse.
81: I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place.
82: One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment.
85: It was a black cat—a very large one—fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one.
86: Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite, splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast.
92: When it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great favorite with my wife.
93: For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me.
96: I avoided the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it.
98: What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes.
107: My wife had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had destroyed.
109: It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to name—and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared—it was now, I say, the image of a hideous—of a ghastly thing—of the Gallows!—oh, mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crime—of Agony and of Death!
117: The moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas!
119: One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit.
120: The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness.
121: Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished.
122: But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.
123: Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp, and buried the axe in her brain.
125: This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body.
132: I determined to wall it up in the cellar—as the monks of the middle ages recorded to have walled up their victims.
144: My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death.
147: It did not make its appearance during the night—and thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul!
157: Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises.
160: They left no nook or corner unexplored.
169: "Gentlemen," I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, "I delight to have allayed your suspicions.
171: By the bye, gentlemen, this—this is a very well constructed house."
174: These walls—are you going, gentlemen?—these walls are solidly put  ;" and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.
176: No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb!—by a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman—a howl—a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.
180: In the next, a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall.
182: The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators.
183: Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman.
184: I had walled the monster up within the tomb!
