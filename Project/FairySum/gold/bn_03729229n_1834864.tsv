1: The king of Long-Tower had once a son, who was the apple of his eye, and on whom he had built all his hopes; and he longed impatiently for the time when he should ﬁnd some good match for him, and hear himself called grandpapa.
2: But the prince was so averse to marriage and so obstinate, that whenever a wife was talked of he shook his head and wished himself a hundred miles off, so that the poor king, finding his son stubborn and perverse, and foreseeing that his race would come to an end, was more vexed and melancholy, cast down and out of spirits, than a merchant whose correspondent has become bankrupt, or a peasant whose ass has died.
5: But as frequently more comes to pass in an hour than in a hundred years, and no one can say, Stop here or go there, it happened that one day, when all were at table, and the prince was cutting a piece of new-made cheese, whilst listening to the chit-chat that was going on, he accidentally cut his finger; and two drops of blood, falling upon the cheese, made such a beautiful mixture of colours, that—either it was a punishment inflicted by Love, or the will of Heaven to console the poor father,—the whim seized the prince to find a woman exactly as white and red as that cheese tinged with his blood.
16: The prince departed, leaving his unhappy father to his grief, and hastened on his way through fields and woods, over mountain and valley, hill and plain, visiting various countries, and mixing with various peoples, and always with his eyes wide awake to see whether he could ﬁnd the object of his desire.
19: And he wandered about and about, until at length he came to the Island of the Ogresses, where be cast anchor and landed.
20: There he found an old old woman, withered and shrivelled up, and with a hideous face, to whom be related the reason that had brought him to that country.
21: The old woman was beside herself with amazement when she heard the strange whim and the fanciful chimera of the prince, and the toils and perils he had gone through to satisfy himself; then she said to him, "Hasten away, my son!
22: for if my three daughters meet you, I would not give a farthing for your life; half alive and half roasted, a frying-pan would be your bier and a belly your grave.
23: But away with you as fast as a hare!
24: and you will not go far before you find what you are seeking."
25: When the prince heard this, frightened, terrified and aghast, he set off running at full speed, and ran till he came to another country, where he again met an old woman, more ugly even than the ﬁrst, to whom he told all his story.
26: Then the old woman said to him in like manner, "Away with you!
27: unless you wish to serve for a breakfast to the little ogresses my daughters; but go straight on, and you will soon ﬁnd what you want."
28: The prince, hearing this, set off running as fast as a dog with a kettle at its tail; and he went on and on, until he met another old woman, who was sitting upon a wheel, with a basket full of little pies and sweetmeats on her arm, and feeding a number of jackasses, which thereupon began leaping about on the bank of a river and kicking at some poor swans.
29: When the prince came up to the old woman, after making a hundred salaamsLiccaralemme—the Alecum-salam or salutation of the Arabs., be related to her the story of his wanderings; whereupon the old woman, comforting him with kind words, gave him such a good breakfast that he licked his fingers after it.
30: And when he had done eating, she gave him three citrons, which seemed to be just fresh gathered from the tree; and she gave him also a beautiful knife, saying, "You are now free to return to Italy, for your labour is ended, and you have what you were seeking.
31: Go your way therefore, and when you are near your own kingdom, stop at the first fountain you come to and cut a citron.
32: Then a fairy will come forth from it, and will say to you, 'Give me to drink!'
33: Mind and be ready with the water, or she will vanish like quicksilver.
35: The prince, overjoyed, kissed the old woman's hairy hand a hundred times, which seemed just like a hedgehog's back.
36: Then taking his leave he left that country, and coming to the seashore sailed for the Pillars of Hercules, and arrived at our Sea; and after a thousand storms and perils, he entered port a day's distance from his own kingdom.
37: There he came to a most beautiful grove, where the Shades formed a palace for the , to prevent their being seen by the Sun; and dismounting at a fountain, which with a crystal tongue was inviting the people to refresh their lips, he seated himself on a Syrian carpet formed by the plants and flowers.
38: Then he drew his knife from the sheath and began to cut the first citron, when lo!
39: there appeared like a flash of lightning a most beautiful maiden, white as milk and red as a strawberry, who said, "Give me to drink!"
40: The prince was so amazed, bewildered and captivated with the beauty of the fairy, that he did not give her the water quickly enough, so she appeared and vanished at one and the same moment.
42: Then the prince cut the second citron, and the same thing happened again; and this was a second blow he got on his pate; so making two little fountains of his eyes, he wept, face to face, tear for tear, drop for drop, with the fountain, and sighing he exclaimed, "Good heavens, how is it that I am so unfortunate?
46: there is still another, and three is the lucky numberIn the original, A le ttrè vence lo Rrè.; either this knife shall give me the fay, or it shall take my life away."
47: So saying he cut the third citron, and forth came the third fairy, who said like the others, "Give me to drink!"
48: Then the prince instantly handed her the water, and behold there stood before him a delicate maiden, white as a junket with red streaks, who looked like an Abruzzi ham or a Nola sausage,—a thing never before seen in the world, with a beauty without compare, a fairness beyond the beyonds, a grace more than the most.
56: At length, seeing that it was all true and no dream, he embraced the fairy, giving her a hundred and a hundred kisses; and after a thousand tender words had passed between them—words which, as a cantofermo, had an accompaniment of sugared kisses—the prince said, "My soul, I cannot take you to my father's kingdom without handsome raiment worthy of so beautiful a person, and an attendance befitting a queen: therefore climb up into this oak-tree, where Nature seems purposely to have made for us a hiding—place in the form of a little room, and here await my return; for I will come back on wings, before a tear can dry, with dresses and servants, and carry you off to my kingdom."
57: So saying, after the usual ceremonies he departed.
58: Now a black slave, who was sent by her mistress with a pitcher to fetch water, came to that well, and seeing by chance the reﬂection of the fairy in the water, she thought it was herself, and exclaimed in amazement, "Poor Lucia, what do I see?
62: So saying she broke the pitcher and returned home; and when her mistress asked her, "Why have you done this mischief?" she replied, "Me go to the well alone, pitcher break upon a stone."
64: So the slave returned to the fountain, and seeing again the beautiful image reﬂected in the water, she said with a deep sigh, "Me no ugly slave, me no broad-foot goose!
67: she broke the cask into seventy pieces, and returned grumbling home, and said to her mistress, "Ass come past, tub fell, down at the well, and all was broken in pieces."
68: The poor mistress, on hearing this, could contain herself no longer, and seizing a broomstick she beat the slave so soundly that she felt it for many days; then giving her a leather bag, she said, "Run, break your neck, you wretched slave, you grasshopper-legs, you black beetle!
70: Away ran the slave heels over head, for she had seen the flash and dreaded the thunder; and while she was filling the leather bag, she turned to look again at the beautiful image, and said, "Me fool to fetch water!
71: better live by one's wits: such a pretty girl indeed to serve a bad mistress!"
72: So saying, she took a large pin which she wore in her hair, and began to prick holes in the leather bag, which looked like an open place in a garden with the rose of a watering-potCo l'acqua a trademiento.
73: making a hundred little fountains.
74: When the fairy saw this she laughed outright; and the slave hearing her, turned and espied her hiding-place up in the tree; whereat she said to herself, "O ho!
75: you make me be beaten?
77: Then she said to her, "What you doing up there, pretty lass?"
78: And the fairy, who was the very mother of courtesy, told her all she knew, and all that had passed with the prince, whom she was expecting from hour to hour and from moment to moment, with fine dresses and servants, to take her with him to his father's kingdom, where they should live happy together.
79: When the slave, who was full of spite, heard this, she thought to herself that she would get this prize into her own hands; so she answered the fairy, "You expect your husband,—me come up and comb your locks, and make you more smart."
81: So the slave climbed up the tree, and the fairy held out her white hand to her, which looked in the black paws of the slave like a crystal mirror in a frame of ebony.
82: But no sooner did the slave begin to comb the fairy's locks, than she suddenly stuck a hair-pin into her head.
83: Then the fairy, feeling herself pricked, cried out, "Dove, dove!"
84: and instantly she became a dove and flew away; whereupon the slave stripped herself, and making a bundle of all the rags that she had worn, she threw them a mile away: and there she sat, up in the tree, looking like a statue of jet in a house of emerald.
85: In a short time the prince returned with a great cavalcade, and finding a cask of caviar where he had left a pan of milk, he stood for awhile beside himself with amazement.
86: At length he said, "Who has made this great blot of ink on the fine paper upon which I thought to write the brightest days of my life?
89: But the crafty slave, observing the prince's amazement, said, "Do not wonder, my prince; for me turned by a wicked spell from a white lily to a black coal."
90: The poor prince, seeing that there was no help for the mischief, drooped his head and swallowed this pill; and bidding the slave come down from the tree, he ordered her to be clothed from head to foot in new dresses.
91: Then sad and sorrowful, cast-down and woebegone, he took his way back with the slave to his own country, where the king and queen, who had gone out six mile to meet them, received them with the same pleasure as a prisoner feels at the announcement of a sentence of Suspendaturi.e.
94: Now whilst they were preparing splendid feasts and banquets, and the cooks were busy plucking geese, killing little pigs, flaying kids, basting the roast-meat, skimming pots, mincing meat for dumplings, larding capons, and preparing a thousand other delicacies, a beautiful dove came flying to the kitchen window, and said,
95: "O cook of the kitchen, tell me, I pray,
96: What the king and the slave are doing today."
98: But no sooner did the lady hear this music, than she gave orders for the dove to be instantly caught and made into a hash.
99: So the cook went, and he managed to catch the dove, and did all that the slave had commanded.
100: And having scalded the bird, in order to pluck it, he threw the water with the feathers out from a balcony on to a garden-bed, on which before three days had passed there sprung up a beautiful citron-tree, which quickly grew to its full size.
103: At the end of a few days three most beautiful citrons appeared, similar to those which the ogress had given Ciommetiello; and when they were grown larger, he plucked them; and shutting himself up in a chamber, with a large basin of water and the knife which he always carried at his side, he began to cut the citrons.
104: Then it all fell out with the first and second fairy just as it had done before; but when at last he cut the third citron, and gave the fairy who came forth from it to drink, behold there stood before him the self-same maiden whom he had left up in the tree, and who told him all the mischief that the slave had done.
108: Then he embraced the fairy, and ordered her to be handsomely drest from head to foot; and taking her by the hand he led her into the middle of the hall, where all the courtiers and great folks of the city were met to celebrate the feast.
109: Then the king called on them one by one, and said, "Tell me, what punishment would that person deserve who should do any harm to this beautiful lady?"
110: And one replied that such a person would deserve a hempen collar—another, a breakfast of stones—a third, a good beating on his stomach—a fourth, a draught of scammony—a fifth, a millstone for a brooch; in short, one said this thing and another that.
111: At last he called on the black queen, and putting the same question, she replied, "Such a person would deserve to be burned, and that her ashes should be thrown from the roof of the castle."
112: When the king heard this he said to her, "You have struck your own foot with the axe, you have made your own fetters, you have sharpened the knife and mixed the poison, for no one has done this lady so much harm as yourself, you good-for-nothing creature!
117: So saying he ordered the slave to be seized and cast alive on to a large burning pile of wood, and her ashes were thrown from the top of the castle to all the winds of heaven, verifying the truth of the saying, that
118: "He who sows thorns should not go barefoot."
