0: Once on a time there was a farmer who had three sons; his means were small, and he was old and weak, and his sons would take to nothing.
1: A fine large wood belonged to the farm, and one day the father told his sons to go and hew wood, and try to pay off some of his debts.
2: Well, after a long talk, he got them to set off, and the eldest was to go first.
4: "If you hew in this wood of mine," said the Troll, "I'll kill you!"
5: When the lad heard that, he threw the axe down, and ran off home as fast as he could lay legs to the ground; so he came in quite out of breath, and told them what had happened, but his father called him "hare-heart,"—no Troll would ever have scared him from hewing when he was young, he said.
6: Next day the second son's turn came, and he fared just the same.
10: The third day Boots wanted to set off.
15: So when he had hewn a bit, the Troll came to him too, and said— "If you hew in this wood of mine, I'll kill you."
16: But the lad was not slow; he pulled his cheese out of the scrip in a trice, and squeezed it till the whey spurted out.
18: he cried to the Troll, "or I'll squeeze you as I squeeze the water out of this white stone."
21: But when even drew near, the Troll said— "Now you'd better come home with me, for my house is nearer than yours."
25: "Nay, nay, dear friend!" said the Troll; "I can't afford to lose my spring; just you make up the fire, and I'll go and fetch the water."
29: So they sat down; but the lad took his scrip unawares to the Troll, and hung it before him, and so he spooned more into the scrip than he ate himself; and when the scrip was full, he took up his knife and made a slit in the scrip.
32: but I can't eat a morsel more."
33: "But you shall eat," said the youth; "I'm only half done; why don't you do as I did, and cut a hole in your paunch?
37: So the Troll did as the lad said, and then you must know very well that he lost his life; but the lad took all the silver and gold that he found in the hill-side, and went home with it, and you may fancy it went a great way to pay off the debt.
