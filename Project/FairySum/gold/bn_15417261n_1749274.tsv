0: THERE was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named Jack, and a cow named Milky-white.
2: But one morning Milky-white gave no milk, and they didn't know what to do.
4: "Cheer up, mother, I'll go and get work somewhere," said Jack.
5: "We've tried that before, and nobody would take you," said his mother; "we must sell Milky-white and with the money start shop, or something."
7: So he took the cow's halter in his hand, and off he started.
8: He hadn't gone far when he met a funny, looking old man, who said to him: "Good morning, Jack."
15: "As you are so sharp," says he, "I don't mind doing a swop with you— your cow for these beans."
16: "Go along," says Jack; "wouldn't you like it?"
17: "Ah! you don't know what these beans are," said the man; "if you plant them over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky."
20: "Right," says Jack, and hands him over Milky-white's halter and pockets the beans.
21: Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn't gone very far it wasn't dusk by the time he got to his door.
22: "Back already, Jack?" said his mother; "I see you haven't got Milkywhite, so you've sold her, How much did you get for her?"
28: What do you say to these beans; they're magical, plant them overnight and——" "What!" says Jack's mother, "have you been such a fool, such a dolt, such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans?
32: And as for your precious beans here they go out of the window.
37: When he woke up, the room looked so funny.
39: So Jack jumped up and dressed himself and went to the window.
41: Why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden, had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up till it reached the sky.
44: So Jack climbed, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he reached the sky.
45: And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart.
46: So he walked along and he walked along and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman.
50: My man is an ogre and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast.
59: the whole house began to tremble with the noise of some one coming.
61: It's my old man," said the ogre's wife, "what on earth shall I do?
63: And she bundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in.
69: I smell the blood of an Englishman,
72: "Nonsense, dear," said his wife, "you're dreaming.
77: Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold, and down he sits and counts till at last his head began to nod
78: and he began to snore till the whole house shook again.
79: Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold, which of course fell into his mother's garden, and then he climbed down and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed her the gold and said: "Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans?
81: So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came to the end of it, and Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more up at the top of the beanstalk.
94: All happened as it did before.
95: In came the ogre as he did before, said: "Fee-fi-fo-fum," and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen.
96: Then he said: "Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs."
97: So she brought it, and the ogre said: "Lay," and it laid an egg all of gold.
98: And then the ogre began to nod his head, and to snore till the house shook.
99: Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden hen, and was off before you could say "Jack Robinson."
104: Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't very long before he determined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk.
106: But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's house.
107: And when he got near it, he waited behind a bush till he saw the ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept into the house and got into the copper.
121: After breakfast was over, the ogre called out "Wife, wife, bring me my golden harp."
122: So she brought it and put it on the table before him.
125: Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door.
126: But the harp called out quite loud: "Master! Master!"
128: Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew where he was going.
134: Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre.
135: By this time Jack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home.
137: Mother! bring me an axe, bring me an axe."
138: And his mother came rushing out with the axe in her hand, but when she came to the beanstalk she stood stock still with fright for there she saw the ogre with his legs just through the clouds.
139: But Jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the beanstalk which cut it half in two.
142: Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the beanstalk came toppling after.
143: Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that and selling the golden eggs Jack and his mother became very rich, and he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever after.
