0: Once on a time there was a poor couple who had a son whose name was Halvor.
1: Ever since he was a little boy he would turn his hand to nothing, but just sat there and groped about in the ashes.
2: His father and mother often put him out to learn this trade or that, but Halvor could stay nowhere; for, when he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the ingle, poking about in the cinders.
3: Well, one day a skipper came and asked Halvor if he hadn't a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands.
5: How long they sailed I'm sure I can't tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn't tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about.
6: Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed lying wind-bound there, and Halvor asked the skipper's leave to go on shore and look about him; he would sooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep.
10: So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat corn-fields and rich meads, but he couldn't catch a glimpse of a living soul.
12: So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it.
13: Halvor followed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone.
15: In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, and Halvor went into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days.
17: So when Halvor had stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat a Princess who span upon a spinning-wheel.
19: she called out, "dare Christian folk come hither?
20: But now you'd best be off about your business, if you don't want the Troll to gobble you up; for here lives a Troll with three heads."
22: As for going, I won't go at all.
23: I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."
24: When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that; hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up.
25: "Oh!" said the Princess, "now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."
26: So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo!
27: just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing.
29: "," said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door," what a smell of Christian man's blood!"
30: "Ay," said Halvor, "you'll soon know that to your cost," and with that he hewed off all his heads.
31: Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said,â€” "Would my sisters were free too!"
32: "Where are they?" asked Halvor.
33: Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his castle, which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his castle, which was fifty miles farther still
34: "But now," she said, "you must first help me to get this ugly carcase out of the house."
35: Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time.
36: So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of gray dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day.
37: When he first saw the castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen.
38: So Halvor went into the kitchen, and did'nt stop there either, but went straight farther on into the house.
39: "Nay, nay," called out the Princess, "dare Christian folk come hither?
41: 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."
42: "I shan't go," said Halvor, "if he had six heads besides."
49: Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door.
51: But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in.
52: The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free.
53: Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once, but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcase out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning.
55: This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the castle
56: There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there wag no end to her loveliness.
57: She, too, like the others, told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads.
58: "Ay, ay," said Halvor, "if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away," and so he stood fast before the stove.
61: Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
64: That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it.
65: So all the Princesses came together to that castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three.
66: But there, after a while, Halvor went about, and was so strange and dull and silent.
67: Then the Princesses asked him what he lacked, and if he didn't like to live with them any longer?
68: Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see.
72: So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king's son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure not to take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he'd never see them more.
73: "If I only stood at home I'd be glad," said Halvor; and it was done as he had wished.
74: Then stood Halvor at his father's cottage door before he knew a word about it.
76: Then Halvor asked if he couldn't stay there, and have a lodging there that night.
88: A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on Halvor's face, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once.
89: "Ah! but is it you after all, Halvor?" she cried; and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared, and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing would do but he must go up at once to the farmer's and show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down on him.
95: Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at Halvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty.
96: "Ay, ay," said Halvor, "you always thought   so pretty and neat, no one could come near you; but now you should just see the eldest Princess I have set free; against her you look just like milkmaids, and the midmost is prettier still; but the youngest, who is my sweetheart, she's fairer than both sun and moon.
97: Would to Heaven she were only here," said Halvor, "then you'd see what you would see."
98: He had scarce uttered these words before there they stood, but then he felt so sorry, for now what they had said came into his mind.
99: Up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the Princesses, and much was made of them, but they wouldn't stop there.
100: "No; we want to go down to your father and mother," they said to Halvor; "
101: and so we'll go out now and look about us."
102: So he went down with them, and they came to a great lake just outside the farm.
104: So they sat down there, and when they had sat a while, the youngest Princess said,â€” "I may as well comb your hair a little, Halvor."
105: Yes, Halvor laid his head on her lap, and so she combed his bonny locks, and it wasn't long before Halvor fell fast asleep.
106: Then she took the ring from his finger, and put another in its stead; and so she said,â€” "Now hold me all together!
107: and now would we were all in Soria Moria Castle."
108: So when Halvor woke up, he could very well tell that he had lost the Princesses, and began to weep and wail; and he was so downcast, they couldn't comfort him at all.
109: In spite of all his father and mother said, he wouldn't stop there, but took farewell of them, and said he was safe not to see them again; for if he couldn't find the Princesses again, he thought it not worth while to live.
123: When he got up to it, he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old couple inside.
127: "Good evening," said the old wife.
130: Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to , and asked if she knew the way thither.
131: "No," said the old wife, "that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything."
132: So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the treetops, the old wife went out.
133: "Thou Moon, Thou Moon," she screamed, "canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"
134: "No," said the Moon, "that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."
135: "Wait a bit still," said the old wife to Halvor, "by and by comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."
143: So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again.
144: Out ran the old wife.
145: "Thou West Wind, Thou West Wind! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle? Here's one who wants to get thither."
147: "Yes, I know it very well," said the West Wind, "and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."
148: Out ran Halvor.
151: "Well," said the West Wind, "now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle."
155: So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them.
158: He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass.
159: Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.
160: "Who is most worthy to have one of us," she said, "he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom."
162: "Ay, ay, here is the right one after all," said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor.
