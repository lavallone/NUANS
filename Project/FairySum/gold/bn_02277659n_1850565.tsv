6: In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors.
8: At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, “Peep, peep.”
28: At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth, crying, “Peep, peep.”
29: It was very large and ugly.
47: The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, “Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already!
48: and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don’t want him here,” and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.
50: “Yes, but he is so big and ugly,” said the spiteful duck “and therefore he must be turned out.”
58: And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry.
62: The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet.
63: So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.
65: So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks.
66: Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
74: After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslins, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy.
79: “Pop, pop,” sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.
81: The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes.
89: It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move.
90: He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could.
92: Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first.
95: A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage.
104: So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs.
111: “Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?” said the tom cat.
112: “No.”
113: “Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.”
114: So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.
115: “What an absurd idea,” said the hen.
116: “You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies.
129: But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable.
133: “I believe I must go out into the world again,” said the duckling.
135: So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance.
141: One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes.
143: They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness.
144: They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea.
148: He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world.
151: The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller.
154: Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened.
155: He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife.
157: But when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.
162: The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.
163: It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes.
168: Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring.
169: From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water.
171: “I will fly to those royal birds,” he exclaimed, “and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter; better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.”
172: Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans.
174: “Kill me,” said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.
175: But what did he see in the clear stream below?
176: His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan.
178: He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
