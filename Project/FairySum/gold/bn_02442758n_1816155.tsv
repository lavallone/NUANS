0: In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper, and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies, and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur’s Round Table.
1: In those days there lived on St. Michael’s Mount, off Cornwall, a huge giant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round, his fierce and savage looks were the terror of all who beheld him.
10: He had just finished, when, taking one step further, he tumbled headlong into the pit, and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him.
12: Another giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever he should have him in his power.
14: The giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, where he locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered with the bodies, skulls, and bones of men and women.
16: Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage, and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, and tied it to the window-bars; he then pulled till he had choked them.
17: When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart.
22: He then very politely gave them the keys of the castle, and went further on his journey to Wales.
24: At length he came to a handsome house.
25: Jack knocked at the door, when there came forth a Welsh giant.
37: The giant, about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his bludgeon struck a many blows on the bed, in the very place where Jack had laid the log; and then he went back to his own room, thinking he had broken all Jack’s bones.
45: When breakfast was over he said to the giant: ‘Now I will show you a fine trick, I can cure all wounds with a touch: I could cut off my head in one minute, and the next put it sound again on my shoulders.
47: He then took hold of the knife, ripped up the leathern bag, and all the hastypudding tumbled out upon the floor.
48: ‘Ods splutter hur nails!’ cried the Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be outdone by such a little fellow as Jack, ‘hur can do that hurself;’ so he snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in a moment dropped down dead.
49: Jack, having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings, resolved not to be idle in future; he therefore furnished himself with a horse, a cap of knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and an invisible coat, the better to perform the wonderfull enterprises that lay before him.
51: Scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady.
52: Jack alighted from his horse, and tying him to an oak tree, put on his invisible coat, under which he carried his sword of sharpness.
53: When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him, but could not reach his body, but wounded his thighs in several places; and at length putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might, he cut off both his legs.
54: Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck, plunged his sword into the giant’s body, when the monster gave a groan and expired.
57: So taking the knight’s directions, he mounted his horse, and soon after came in sight of another giant, who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brother’s return.
58: Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on his invisible coat, approached and aimed a blow at the giant’s head, but missing his aim he only cut off his nose.
61: so jumping upon the block, he stabbed him in the back, when he dropped down dead.
62: Jack then proceeded on his journey, and travelled over hills and dales, till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a lonely house, when an old man let him in.
63: When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him: ‘My son, on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the giant Galligantus and a vile magician.
64: I lament the fate of a duke’s daughter, whom they seized as she was walking in her father’s garden, and brought hither transformed into a deer.’
67: On the castle gate he found a golden trumpet, under which were written these lines:—
68: Whoever can this trumpet blow
69: Shall cause the giant’s overthrow.
70: As soon as Jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrill blast, which made the gates fly open and the very castle itself tremble.
72: Jack, with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the magician was then carried away by a whirlwind; and every knight and beautiful lady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes.
75: Jack then went up to the King, and gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles.
76: Jack’s fame had now spread through the whole country, and at the King’s desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of all his kingdom.
77: After this the King gave him a large estate, on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.
