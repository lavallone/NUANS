20: Pharaoh alone had committed the sacrilege.
21: It was he, angered because the bridge, which he had spent five years in construct-ing so that one day he might cross the Nile in his chariot as he had once boasted that he would do, had been swept away by the rising waters.
23: He had barred the temple doors and with his own breath had blown out the sacred candles.
25: Even, it was said in low, shocked whispers, in a mock ceremony of worship he had burned the carrion of a hyena, most abhorrent of all beasts to Osiris, upon the holy altar of gold, which even the most high of priests forbore to lay naked hands upon!
28: Standing before the awed assembly of nobles, the high Kha Semblor made a gesture with his hands.
31: Death had been pronounced as doom for the pharaoh.
33: The crowd came out, and within an hour a well-organized mob passed through the streets of Thebes, directed for the palace of the pharaoh.
35: Within the resplendent portals of the palace the pharaoh, ruler of all Egypt, watched with tightened brow the orderly but menacing ap-proach of the mob.
58: The mob, led by the black-robed priests and nobles who had arrived at the foot of the steps, now fell back before the stunning, magnificent defiance of their giant ruler.
64: In his triumph and exultation, the pharaoh had been careless of the crum-bling edges of the steps.
71: A hoarse cry burst from his lips; his sword fell; and then his body thudded down the steps in a series of wild somersaults, and landed at the foot, sprawled out before the gasping mob.
76: The struggling body of the pharaoh was lifted up and torn to pieces by their clawing hands and weapons.
80: A week later another large assembly of persons confronted the bril-liant-pillared palace.
82: The week before they had rended the pharaoh and now they were proclaiming his sister empress.
89: Not long after the beauteous Nitocris mounted the golden throne of Egypt, rumors were whispered of some vast, mysterious enterprise being conducted in secret.
100: The men who went eagerly to investigate the mysterious construction returned with tales of a magnificent new temple, surrounded by rich green, tropical verdure, situated near the bank of the river.
107: True to the predictions of the gossipers, before the month had passed the banquet had been formally announced and to all the nobility and the priests of Osiris had been issued invitations to attend.
140: However, when the concluding processional chant had been completed the queen summoned a number of burly slaves, and by several iron rings attached to its outer edge they lifted up a large slab of the flooring, disclosing to the astonished guests the fact that the scene of the banquet was to be an immense subterranean vault.
154: Immediately all of the guests gathered around the banquet tables, and the next hour was occupied in gluttonous feasting.
172: When the hour had approached near to midnight, the queen, who had sat like one entranced, arose from the cushioned dais.
178: When she had ar-rived at the top of the stairs she looked down and observed that no one had marked her exit.
185: Drawing the soft and shimmering folds of her cloak about her with fingers that trembled with eagerness, excitement and the intense emo-tion which she felt, the queen passed swiftly across the stone floor of the temple toward the open front through which the night wind swept, blowing her cloak in sheenful waves about her tall and graceful figure.
191: Out upon a rough and apparently new-constructed stone pier the thin path led.
197: In the foreground of the pier a number of fantastic, wandlike levers extended upward.
199: When she had come beside them, she grasped one up thrust bar, fiercely, as if it had been the throat of a hated antagonist.
201: This was to her a moment of supreme ecstasy.
206: This was the lever that opened the wall in the banquet vault.
210: Savagely this time she pulled it; then with the litheness of a tiger she sprang to the edge of the pier.
213: It was the sound of waters suddenly diverted into a new channel—an eager, plunging sound.
214: Down to the hall of revelry they were rushing—these savage waters—bringing terror and sudden death.
252: Here in the temple of Osiris those nobles and priests who had slain the pharaoh in expiation of his sacrilege against Osiris had now met their deaths.
253: And it was in the waters of the Nile, material symbol of the god Osiris, that they had died.
263: The morning of the day after the massacre in the temple, the guests of the queen not having made their return, the citizens of Thebes began to glower with dark suspicions.
269: When in the evening the queen arrived in the city, pale, silent, and obviously nervous, threatening crowds blocked the path of her chariot, demanding roughly an explanation of the disappearance of her guests.
271: Well she knew, how-ever, that her life would be doomed as soon as they confirmed their suspicions.
273: Therefore upon her entrance into the palace she ordered her slaves to fill instantly her boudoir with hot and smoking ashes.
274: When this had been done, she went to the room, entered it, closed the door and locked it securely, and then flung herself down upon a couch in the center of the room.
275: In a short time the scorching heat and the suffocating thick fumes of the smoke overpowered her.
