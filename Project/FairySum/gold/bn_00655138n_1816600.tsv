0: DETECTIVE CRADDOCK stepped nearer the front of the little cigar store on the corner, and almost pressed his nose against the window as he glanced inside.
7: Thubway Tham was a clever pickpocket, one of the cleverest in the business, and he worked only in the subway during rush hours.
15: Thubway Tham was behind the counter, waiting on trade.
56: “There’s sure something crazy about it,” said Craddock.
57: The detective left the store, watched from the corner for a time, and then went about his business.
61: It might have been an insane moment, but, Thubway Tham was enjoying it hugely, the more so because his actions mystified Detective Craddock.
62: He sold a package of cigarettes to an evillooking youth, and changed a five-dollar bill.
63: Ten minutes later his employer, going through the cash register, found the bill and informed Thubway Tham that it was a counterfeit.
82: There came a lull in business in the middle of the afternoon, and then it was that a well-dressed young man entered and announced his intention of purchasing a box of cigars that retailed at fifteen dollars the box.
83: Thubway Tham showed the goods eagerly, still determined to make an excellent record on his first day.
85: The telephone rang.
87: It was his employer who called, and he gave minute instructions regarding a package of goods that should be wrapped up for a certain customer.
88: Thubway Tham made a note with a pencil on a sheet of paper, hung up the receiver, and turned toward his customer again.
89: The customer was gone, and so were two boxes of the cigars, stock worth thirty dollars.
94: Thubway Tham sighed and extracted thirty dollars from his own pocket and put the money in the till.
114: Some sense of delicacy prevented Tham telling the visitor to the city that his appearance and manner were a standing invitation to pickpockets.
132: He announced that he would shake dice with Tham for the cigars.
136: They continued to shake dice, and the customer from out of town began winning.
143: Tham’s boss came back, and the customer hurried away.
144: “The old coot trimmed me for five,” Tham explained, in a manner apologetic.
159: He felt in his vest pocket, took out a fivedollar bill, and put it in the cash register.
174: Without waiting to argue the matter, Thubway Tham hurried down the street, came to Union Square, and darted toward the entrance to the subway.
175: A short distance behind, Detective Craddock followed.
176: A train roared into the station, and Thubway Tham got aboard.
179: Craddock boarded the train also, and Thubway Tham knew it, but gave no sign.
193: He walked briskly up the street, and on a certain corner came to a stop.
196: He saw the stranger within the city’s gates, who had beaten him with loaded dice.
197: And he saw the evil-looking youth who had slipped him the counterfeit bill.
198: Thubway Tham knew at a glance that the evil-appearing youth was a crook, that he had spotted the visitor to the city, and was hoping to relieve him of his wealth.
202: Craddock forgot Tham entirely and gave his attention to the others.
209: After a time the evil-looking youth scientifically removed the wallet from the other’s hip pocket.
210: The next instant Detective Craddock had him by the arm.
218: Thubway Tham exulted.
223: They got into a crowded car, and Tham kept Craddock from seeing him.
226: The proper station was reached, the doors were opened.
227: Detective Craddock started to leave the car with his two men.
228: Thubway Tham stepped up close behind him for an instant—and in that instant his hand dived into Craddock’s pocket and took out the countryman’s wallet.
235: Tham left the train at the next station, walked rapidly down the street, then turned into an alley.
236: When he thought it was safe, he investigated the wallet.
237: There were some newspaper clippings in it, some receipts, but no money.
246: He stood on a corner and contemplated a crowd, wondering whether to risk fortune by picking a pocket there.
248: Somebody slapped him on the shoulder.
293: They went along a dark side street, but Tham had no chance to get the money.
301: I can’t enjoy myself while I’m worryin’ about my money.
302: You take it—here—and keep it for me.
303: Give me a bill whenever I ask for it.”
314: Here was a man trusting him with money—the man he had hoped to rob.
321: They changed some of the bills, but when midnight came, and the visitor decided that he would return to his hotel and go to bed, there remained something like seventy-five dollars.
322: Thubway Tham handed it back, made the other count it and acknowledge the amount correct, and then parted from his man with a feeling that he had done a worthy action.
337: Had the visitor to the city played him for an easy mark, got him to pass the money so that, if an arrest came, Tham would be the one arrested?
341: With a heavy heart Thubway Tham began making the rounds.
343: Thubway Tham gave good bills and collected the bad ones, and explained how he had been worked.
349: He plunged into the subway, got into a crowded car, “lifted a leather,” and got out at Twenty-eighth street.
351: He took out bills and dropped the wallets.
357: “It doth not pay to try to be honetht!
