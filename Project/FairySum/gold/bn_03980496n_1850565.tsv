7: There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly: he was every morning the first out of bed, and the last to go to rest at night; and, whenever there was a difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he was always the first to set himself to it.
9: When the third year also was past, the master considered, put his hand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out.
10: Then at last the servant said, "Master, for three years I have served you honestly, be so good as to give me what I ought to have; for I wish to leave, and look about me a little more in the world."
11: "Yes, my good fellow," answered the old miser; "you have served me industriously, and, therefore, you shall be cheerfully rewarded;" and he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three farthings, saying, "There, you have a farthing for each year; that is large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from few masters."
12: The honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought, "Ah! now that I have my purse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work!"
14: Now it came to pass that as he was going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to himy "Whither away, merry brother?
21: "Look here," said the dwarf, "I am a poor needy man, give me your three farthings; I can work no longer, but you are young, and can easily earn your bread."
22: And as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the old man, he gave him the three farthings, saying, "Take them in the name of Heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it."
23: Then the little man said, "As I see you have a good "Aha?" said the servant, "you are one of those who can work wonders!
24: Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for a gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at; secondly, for a fiddle, which when I play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance; thirdly, that if I ask a favour of any one he shall not be able to refuse it."
28: What can one desire more?" said the servant to himself, and went merrily onwards.
29: Soon afterwards he met a Jew with a long goat's-beard, who was standing listening to the song of a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree.
30: "Good heavens," he was exclaiming, "that such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice!
31: if it were but mine!
33: "If that is all," said the servant, "the bird shall soon be down here;" and taking aim he pulled the trigger, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.
35: "Oh!" said the Jew, "leave out the rogue, my master, and I will do it at once.
36: I will get the bird out for myself, as you really have hit it."
38: When he was fast among the thorns, the good servant's humour so tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play.
39: In a moment the Jew's legs began to move, and to jump into the air, and the more the servant fiddled the better went the dance.
40: But the thorns tore his shabby coat for him, combed his beard, and pricked and plucked him all over the body.
41: "Oh dear," cried the Jew, "what do I want with your fiddling?
42: leave the fiddle alone, master; I do not want to dance."
43: But the servant did not listen to him, and thought, The Jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was far off and out of sight, and then he screamed out with all his might, "You miserable musician, you beer-house fiddler!
47: As soon as he had refreshed himself a little in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town to the justice.
48: "My lord judge," he said, "I have come to make a complaint; see how a rascal has robbed and ill-treated me on the public highway!
52: So the judge sent his people out after the man, and they found the good servant, who had been going quite slowly along, and they found, too, the purse with the money upon him.
55: And because he had committed robbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be hanged.
59: The servant walked quietly with the hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round and said to the judge, "Grant me just one request before I die."
60: "Yes, if you do not ask your life," said the judge.
61: "I do not ask for life," answered the servant, "but as a last favour let me play once more upon my fiddle."
62: The Jew raised a great cry of "Murder! murder!
63: for goodness' sake do not allow it!
65: But the judge said, "Why should I not let him have this short pleasure?
66: it has been granted to him, and he shall have it."
74: Soon all who had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing with them; old and young, fat and lean, one with another.
78: Then he went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground panting for breath, and said, "You rascal, now confess, whence you got the money, or I will take my fiddle and begin to play again."
79: "I stole it, I stole it!" cried he; "but you have honestly earned it."
80: So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief.
