0: In the happy times when Fairies existed, there reigned a King who had three daughters.
1: They were young and beautiful, and all three possessed considerable merit; but the youngest was the most amiable and the best beloved.
2: They called her Merveilleuse.
20: A magnificent banquet was served up: the King and his three daughters sat down to table; and as it was his habit to draw inferences from everything, he said to the eldest, "Tell me, pray, why have you put on a green gown?"
21: "Sire," she answered, "having heard of your achievements, I fancied that green would express the joy and hope with which your return inspired me."
23: "And you, my child," he continued; "why do you wear a blue gown?"
24: "My liege," said the Princess, "to indicate that we should unceasingly implore for you the protection of the Gods, and also that the sight of you is to me like that of heaven and all the starry host!"
26: "And you, Merveilleuse; what reason had you for dressing yourself in white?"
27: "Because, Sire," she answered, "it becomes me better than any colour."
29: "My motive was to please you," said the Princess; "it appears to me that I ought to have no other."
30: The King, who loved her dearly, was so perfectly satisfied with this explanation, that he declared himself much pleased by the little turn she had given to her meaning, and the art with which she had at first concealed the compliment.
34: Tell me what you all dreamed of the night before my return."
35: The eldest said she dreamed that he had brought her a gown, the gold and jewels of which shone brighter than the sun.
36: The second said she dreamed that he had brought her a golden distaff to spin herself some shifts with.
37: The youngest said she dreamed that he had married her second sister, and that on the wedding-day he held a golden ewer, and said, "Merveilleuse, come hither and wash."
38: The King, indignant at this dream, knit his brow, and made an exceedingly wry face.
40: He retired to his chamber, and flung himself into bed.
46: He rose in a fury; and though it was not yet daylight, he sent for the captain of his guards, and said to him, "You have heard the dream of Merveilleuse: it prognosticates strange things against me.
47: I command you to seize her immediately, to take her into the forest, and kill her; after which, you will bring me her heart and her tongue, that I may be sure you have not deceived me, or I will have you put to death in the most cruel manner possible."
51: The captain went directly to the Princess's apartment, where he found some difficulty in obtaining admission, for it was still very early.
52: He informed Merveilleuse that the King desired to see her.
53: She rose immediately; a little Moorish girl, named Patypata, carried her train.
54: A young ape, and a little dog, who always accompanied her, ran after her.
55: The ape was called Grabugeon, and the little dog, Tintin.
59: It was just getting light: the Princess looked at her conductor; he had tears in his eyes, and was so dejected that he could not speak.
60: "What is the matter?" inquired she in the kindest tone; "you seem very much distressed."
61: "Ah, Madam!" exclaimed he; "who could be otherwise at the most dreadful order that was ever given!
62: The King has commanded me to kill you in this forest, and to take him your heart and your tongue.
73: Patypata, who had heard all that had passed, and of whose presence neither the captain of the guards nor the Princess was aware, so absorbed were they in their affliction, advanced boldly, and threw herself at the feet of Merveilleuse.
74: "Madam," said she, "I offer you my life.
79: Grabugeon then stepped forward, and said, "You have reason, Princess, to love so faithful a slave as Patypata; she can be of much more use to you than I. I offer you my tongue and heart with joy, wishing to immortalize myself in the annals of the Empire of Monkeys."
81: "It would be insupportable to me," exclaimed Tintin, "good little dog as I am, should any one
82: but myself
83: lay down their life for my mistress.
87: At last, Grabugeon, more hasty than the others, ran up to the very top of a tree, and flinging herself down head foremost, was killed on the spot.
88: Much as the Princess lamented her, she consented, as the poor thing was dead, that the captain of the guards should cut out her tongue; but it was so small, (for altogether the creature was not bigger than one's fist,) that to their great grief they felt convinced the King would not be deceived by it.
91: "It is for me that honour is reserved," interrupted the Moor, snatching up as she spoke the knife that had been used upon Grabugeon, and plunging it into her bosom.
92: The captain of the guards would have taken her tongue, but it was so black that he could not flatter himself he could cheat the king with it.
96: Merveilleuse kissed her little dog, weeping so bitterly over him that she was quite exhausted.
97: She turned hastily away, and when she ventured again to look round, her conductor was gone, and she found herself alone with the dead bodies of her Moor, her ape, and her little dog.
98: She could not quit the spot till she had buried them in a hole which she found by chance at the foot of a tree, upon which she afterwards scratched these words:—
101: She then began to think of her own safety, and as there was none for her in that forest, which was so close to her father's castle that the first person who saw her would recognise her, or where she might be eaten like a chicken by the lions and wolves that infested it, she set off walking as fast as she could.
108: At length she heard a sheep bleat.
109: "No doubt," said she, "there are some shepherds here with their flocks.
114: What was her surprise, on arriving in an open space surrounded by trees, to see a large Ram, whiter than snow, whose horns were gilt, who had a garland of flowers round his neck, his legs entwined with ropes of pearls of prodigious size, and chains of diamonds hung about him, and who was reposing on a couch of orange blossoms.
116: A hundred gaily-decked sheep were around him, who in lieu of browzing on the grass, were taking, some, coffee, sherbet, ices, and lemonade; others, strawberries and cream, and sweetmeats.
121: "Approach, divine Princess," said he to her, "and fear nothing from such gentle and peaceful animals as we are."
154: The Master-Ram told the Princess to consider herself the sovereign of these regions; that for some years past he had had much cause for sorrow and tears; but that it only depended on her to make him forget all his misfortunes.
155: "There is something so generous in your behaviour, charming Ram," said she to him, "and everything I see here appears to me so extraordinary, that I know not what to make of it."
156: She had scarcely uttered these words when there appeared before her a troop of nymphs of the most admirable beauty.
157: They presented her with fruit in baskets of amber, but when she advanced towards them they insensibly receded; she extended her hands to touch them, but felt nothing, and ascertained that they were only phantoms.
160: She began to weep, and King Ram, (for so they called him,) who had left her for a few minutes, returning and finding her in tears, was in such despair that he felt he should die at her feet.
165: "Do not be alarmed," replied the Ram; "deign to listen to me calmly, and you shall hear my sad history.
166: "I was born to a throne.
172: I was exceedingly fond of hunting, and the eager pursuit of a stag having separated me from my attendants, I suddenly saw him plunge into a pond.
173: I spurred my horse in after him, as imprudently as boldly, but instead of the coldness of the water I felt an extraordinary heat.
174: The pond dried up, and through an opening, out of which issued terrible flames, I fell to the bottom of a precipice, where nothing was to be seen but fire.
175: "I thought myself lost, when I heard a voice which said to me, 'No less fire could warm thy heart, ungrateful one!' 'Hah! who is it that complains of my coldness?' said I. 'An unfortunate who adores thee without hope,' replied the voice.
176: At the same moment the flames were extinguished, and I perceived a Fairy whom I had known from my earliest infancy, and whose age and ugliness had always horrified me.
177: She was leaning on a young slave of incomparable beauty; the golden chains she wore sufficiently betokened her condition.
178: 'What prodigy is this, Ragotte,' said I to her, (so is the Fairy named;) can this really be by your orders?' 'By whose orders should it be?' replied the Fairy.
193: 'Well then, love me!'
194: added she, pursing up her mouth to make it look more agreeable, and rolling her eyes about; 'I will be thy little Ragotte, I will add twenty kingdoms to that thou hast already, an hundred towers full of gold, five hundred full of silver,—in a word, all thou canst wish for.'
195: 'Madame Ragotte,' said I to her, 'it is not at the bottom of a pit in which I expected to be roasted that I should think of making a declaration to a person of your merit; I implore you by all the charms that adorn you to set me at liberty, and then we will consider together what can be done for your satisfaction.'
199: Thou hopest to escape, but I give thee notice that thou shalt remain here, and thy first task shall be to keep my sheep.
201: I paid little attention to them; the beauty of the slave beside her appeared to me marvellous; my eyes betrayed me.
202: The cruel Ragotte, noticing my admiration, flew upon her and plunged a bodkin into one of her eyes with such violence that the adorable girl fell dead upon the spot.
203: At this horrible sight I threw myself upon Ragotte, and, sword in hand, would have immolated her to those dear manes, if by her power she had not rendered me motionless.
204: All my efforts were in vain; I fell to the earth, and sought for means to slay myself, to end the agony I was in, when the Fairy said to me with an ironical smile, 'I will make thee know my power; thou art a lion at present, thou shalt become a sheep.'
209: The talking sheep you see here acknowledged me as their king; they informed me that they were unfortunate mortals who had in various ways given offence to the vindictive Fairy, and had been formed by her into a flock; that the penance of some was of less duration than that of others.
211: As for the shadows you have seen, they are those of the rivals and enemies of Ragotte whom she has deprived of life for a century or so, and who will afterwards return to the world.
219: Merveilleuse was so agitated by all she had heard, that she scarcely knew how to answer him.
221: "Alas!" continued she, "if my poor Patypata, my dear Grabugeon, and the pretty Tintin, who died to save me, could meet with a similar fate, I should not be so melancholy here."
222: Notwithstanding the degradation of the royal Ram, he possessed some very great privileges.
223: "Go," said he to his grand equerry, (a very good-looking sheep,) "go fetch the moor, the ape, and the little dog; their shades will amuse our Princess."
228: The Princess thus passed her days in peace, awaiting a happier lot.
231: One day, on the arrival of the couriers,—for he regularly sent out for the news, and always had the first and best intelligence,—he learned that the eldest sister of Princess Merveilleuse was about to marry a great prince, and that nothing could be more magnificent than the preparations they were making for the nuptials.
232: "Ah!" said the young Princess, "how unfortunate I am to be deprived of the sight of so many fine things!
235: "What reason have you to complain, Madam?" said the King of the Sheep; "have I refused you permission to go to the wedding?
236: Depart as soon as you please, only give me your word that you will return.
237: If you do not agree to that, you will see me expire at your feet, for my attachment to you is too violent for me to lose you and live."
247: She arrived at her father's court at the moment the marriage was being celebrated.
248: As soon as she appeared, she dazzled everybody by the blaze of her beauty and of the jewels which adorned her.
250: The King gazed on her with such eagerness and pleasure that she was afraid he would recognise her; but he was so convinced of her death that he had not the least idea she was his daughter.
251: The fear, notwithstanding, that she should be detained, prevented her staying to quite the end of the ceremony.
252: She departed abruptly, leaving a little coral box, garnished with emeralds, and with these words on it, in diamond sparks: "Jewels for the Bride."
254: The King, who had hoped to see her again and was burning to know who she was, was in despair at her departure.
255: He gave strict orders that if ever she returned, they should shut the gates upon her and detain her.
262: Some short time afterwards the King married his second daughter.
263: Merveilleuse heard of it, and entreated the Ram to permit her to witness, as before, a fête in which she took so much interest.
268: She assured him that she would return as quickly as she did the first time: that she should be deeply pained by anything that could keep her from him; and entreated him not to be uneasy about her.
269: She went in the same state as before, and arrived just as they were commencing the marriage ceremony.
272: The King was charmed to see her once more.
273: He never took his eyes off her, except to order all the doors to be closed to prevent her departure.
274: The ceremony being nearly concluded, the Princess rose hastily that she might disappear in the crowd, but she was extremely surprised and distressed to find that all the gates were locked.
275: The King accosted her with great respect and a submissive air that reassured her.
277: He led her into a magnificent saloon, in which all the court were assembled, and offered to her himself a golden basin and a ewer filled with water, that she might wash her beautiful hands.
278: At this, she could no longer suppress her emotions; she flung herself at his feet, and embracing his knees, exclaimed, "Behold, my dream has come true!
280: The King recognised her with less difficulty, as he had more than once been struck by her great resemblance to Merveilleuse.
281: "Ah! my dear daughter," said he, embracing her with tears in his eyes, "can you forget my cruelty?
282: I sought your life because I thought your dream prognosticated the loss of my crown.
283: It did so, indeed," continued he, "for here are your two sisters married, and each has a crown of her own, therefore mine shall be yours."
284: So saying, he rose, and placed his crown on the head of the Princess, crying, "Long live Queen Merveilleuse!"
293: But whilst she was thus engrossed by the King and her sisters, the enamoured Ram saw the hour fixed for the return of the Princess pass by, and his anxiety became so extreme that he could not control it.
299: When he reached the King's palace, he asked to see Merveilleuse; but as everybody was now aware of her adventures, and by no means desired that she should return to the realms of the Ram, they harshly refused to admit him to her presence.
301: At length, broken-hearted, he flung himself on the ground, and breathed his last sigh.
303: The King proposed to his daughter to mount a triumphal car, and show herself to all the city by the lights of thousands and thousands of flambeaux which illuminated the windows and all the great squares; but what a horrible spectacle for her, to see, as she issued from the palace-gates, her dear Ram stretched breathless on the pavement!
305: In her despair, she felt she should die herself.
