14: Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934-5, taking the upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College Street—on the crest of the great eastward hill near the Brown University campus and behind the marble John Hay Library.
18: Blake's study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden on one side, while its west windows—before one of which he had his desk—faced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the lower town's outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed behind them.
20: Against these, some two miles away, rose the spectral hump of Federal Hill, bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously, taking fantastic forms as the smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them.
30: Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most fascinated Blake.
39: He believed that a vague, singular aura of desolation hovered over the place, so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves.
48: Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made his first trip into the unknown.
56: Again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone, and this time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned.
57: The dark man's face had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curious sign with his right hand.
64: The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude.
71: Desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place, and in the birdless eaves and black, ivyless walls Blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister beyond his power to define.
72: There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at the northerly end and approached him with questions about the church.
74: When Blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the Italian priest warned everybody against it, vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark.
76: There had been a bad sect there in the old days—an outlaw sect that called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night.
85: It excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him, and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoat had repeated.
99: The sheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it, but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the façade.
106: Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strewn concrete floor.
128: This place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe.
135: Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple—objects so long familiar to him at a distance.
139: Here he was doomed to disappointment; for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and clearly devoted to vastly different purposes.
142: In the centre of the dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs.
143: On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form; its hinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding what looked beneath the decade-deep dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through.
146: As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on the strange open box of yellowish metal.
147: Approaching, he tried to clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting entities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this planet.
148: The four-inch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter.
153: When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple.
157: It was a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time.
160: Blake examined the latter with care, finding within it several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893, some cards with the name "Edwin M. Lillibridge", and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda.
162: Its disjointed text included such phrases as the following:
164: Dr. Drowne of 4th Baptist warns against Starry Wisdom in sermon 29 Dec. 1844.
166: 1846—3 disappearances—first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.
167: 7 disappearances 1848—stories of blood sacrifice begin.
169: Fr. O'Malley tells of devil-worship with box found in great Egyptian ruins—says they call up something that can't exist in light. Flees a little light, and banished by strong light. Then has to be summoned again. Probably got this from deathbed confession of Francis X. Feeney, who had joined Starry Wisdom in '49. These people say the Shining Trapezohedron shows them heaven & other worlds, & that the Haunter of the Dark tells them secrets in some way.
178: Ghost stories begin around 1880—try to ascertain truth of report that no human being has entered church since 1877.
191: Before he realized it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind.
195: Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing, indeterminate panic fear.
196: Blake choked and turned away from the stone, conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness.
203: What was it that the dead man's notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron?
207: Blake seized the cover of the long-open box and snapped it down.
209: At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the steeple's eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door.
211: And yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted basement, out amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square, and down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of Federal Hill towards the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks of the college district.
213: Instead, he read much in certain books, examined long years of newspaper files downtown, and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room.
221: It was in June that Blake's diary told of his victory over the cryptogram.
224: There are references to a Haunter of the Dark awaked by gazing into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures about the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called.
226: Some of Blake's entries show fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalk abroad; though he adds that the streetlights form a bulwark which cannot be crossed.
227: Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth.
238: In writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire.
240: Then something in the Journal on the morning of 17 July threw the diarist into a veritable fever of horror.
242: In the night a thunderstorm had put the city's lighting-system out of commission for a full hour, and in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with fright.
243: Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps' absence and gone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, altogether dreadful way.
245: It could go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it fleeing.
246: When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the tower, for even the feeble light trickling through the grime-blackened, louvre-boarded windows was too much for the thing.
248: During the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas—a guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness.
251: That evening in the Bulletin Blake read of what the reporters had found.
258: What disturbed Blake the most—except for the hints of stains and charring and bad odours—was the final detail that explained the crashing glass.
267: From this point onwards Blake's diary shows a mounting tide of insidious horror and nervous apprehension.
268: He upbraids himself for not doing something, and speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown.
272: But his worst fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeple—that monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black spaces.
276: Again and again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him.
297: The great storm broke just before midnight on 8 August.
300: Blake was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system, and tried to telephone the company around 1 A.M. though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interests of safety.
303: Now and then he would fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases such as "The lights must not go"; "It knows where I am"; "I must destroy it"; and "it is calling to me, but perhaps it means no injury this time"; are found scattered down two of the pages.
304: Then the lights went out all over the city.
306: The entry is merely, "Lights out—God help me."
309: A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew threateningly dark.
331: The next day's papers gave these matters minor mention in connection with the general storm reports.
332: It seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east, where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise noticed.
334: Of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill, or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens.
336: A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but his observation has not been verified.
338: These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connection with the death of Robert Blake.
342: The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive fright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened dismay.
346: Blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last, and the broken-pointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand.
347: The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and legible only in part.
351: These are the entries—or all that can be made of them:
362: I see it—coming here—hell-wind—titan blur—black wing—Yog Sothoth save me—the three-lobed burning eye . . .
