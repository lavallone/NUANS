0: ALYOSHA was the younger brother.
1: He was called the Pot, because his mother had once sent him with a pot of milk to the deacon's wife, and he had stumbled against something and broken it.
7: Alyosha went to the village school, but was not good at lessons; besides, there was so little time to learn.
8: His elder brother was in town, working for a merchant, so Alyosha had to help his father from a very early age.
15: Alyosha was nineteen when his brother was taken as a soldier.
16: So his father placed him with the merchant as a yard-porter.
28: The family was not a large one.
30: They did not take to Alyosha at first.
31: He was uncouth, badly dressed, and had no manner, but they soon got used to him.
32: Alyosha worked even better than his brother had done; he was really very willing.
33: They sent him on all sorts of errands, but he did everything quickly and readily, going from one task to another without stopping.
42: And Alyosha ran here, looked after this and that, forgot nothing, found time for everything, and was always cheerful.
59: At holiday times there was more work than ever, but Alyosha liked holidays because everybody gave him a tip.
63: His father used to come and take them from the merchant, and only scold Alyosha for wearing out his boots.
70: He discovered one day, to his great surprise, that, in addition to the relation of usefulness existing between people, there was also another, a peculiar relation of quite a different character.
73: He made this discovery through the cook Ustinia.
75: He felt for the first time in his life that he—not his services, but he himself—was necessary to another human being.
91: On one occasion she asked him if his parents intended marrying him soon.
94: "I would marry you, if you'd be willing."
98: At Shrovetide Alyosha's father came to town for his wages.
99: It had come to the ears of the merchant's wife that Alyosha wanted to marry Ustinia, and she disapproved of it.
124: His father talked and talked, while Alyosha stood still and sighed.
141: From that day Alyosha went about his work as usual, and no longer talked to Ustinia about their getting married.
142: One day in Lent the clerk told him to clear the snow from the roof.
143: Alyosha climbed on to the roof and swept away all the snow; and, while he was still raking out some frozen lumps from the gutter, his foot slipped and he fell over.
155: Alyosha lay in bed for two days, and on the third day they sent for the priest.
168: "As it is good here when you obey and do no harm to others, so it will be there," was the thought within it.
169: He spoke very little; he only said he was thirsty, and he seemed full of wonder at something.
170: He lay in wonderment, then stretched himself, and died.
