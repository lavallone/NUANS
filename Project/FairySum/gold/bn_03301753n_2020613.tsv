0: WELL, there was once a very rich gentleman, and he had three daughters, and he thought he'd see how fond they were of him.
8: So he says to the third, "How much do you love me, my dear?"
9: "Why, I love you as fresh meat loves salt," says she.
11: "You don't love me at all," says he, "and in my house you stay no more."
13: Well, she went away on and on till she came to a fen, and there she gathered a lot of rushes and made them into a kind of a sort of a cloak with a hood, to cover her from head to foot, and to hide her fine clothes.
14: And then she went on and on till she came to a great house.
19: So she stayed there and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans and did all the dirty work.
20: And because she gave no name they called her "Cap o' Rushes."
21: Well, one day there was to be a great dance a little way off, and the servants were allowed to go and look on at the grand people.
22: Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, so she stayed at home.
23: But when they were gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes, and cleaned herself, and went to the dance.
25: Well, who should be there but her master's son, and what should he do but fall in love with her the minute he set eyes on her.
48: He danced with none but her and never took his eyes off her.
49: When she wouldn't tell him her name, nor where she came from, he gave her a ring and told her if he didn't see her again he should die.
50: Well, before the dance was over, off she slipped, and home she went, and when the maids came home she was pretending to be asleep with her cap 'o rushes on.
53: The master's son he tried every way to find out where the lady was gone, but go where he might, and ask whom he might, he never heard anything about her.
54: And he got worse and worse for the love of her till he had to keep his bed.
55: "Make some gruel for the young master," they said to the cook.
60: "Let me make it," says Cap o' Rushes.
62: And when she had made it, she slipped the ring into it on the sly before the cook took it upstairs.
63: The young man he drank it and then he saw the ring at the bottom.
66: "Who made this gruel here?" says he.
71: "Well, then, 't was Cap o' Rushes," says she.
72: "Send Cap o' Rushes here," says he.
76: "Where did you get this ring?" says he.
77: "From him that gave it me," says she.
78: "Who are you, then?" says the young man.
79: "I'll show you," says she.
80: And she offed with her cap o' rushes, and there she was in her beautiful clothes.
81: Well, the master's son he got well very soon, and they were to be married in a little time.
82: It was to be a very grand wedding, and every one was asked far and near.
83: And Cap o' Rushes's father was asked.
85: But before the wedding, she went to the cook, and says she: "I want you to dress every dish without a mite o' salt."
90: And after they were married, all the company sat down to the dinner.
91: When they began to eat the meat, it was so tasteless they couldn't eat it.
92: But Cap o' Rushes's father tried first one dish and then another, and then he burst out crying.
94: "Oh!" says he, "I had a daughter.
97: And I turned her from my door, for I thought she didn't love me.
98: And now I see she loved me best of all.
100: "No, father, here she is!" said Cap o' Rushes.
102: And so they were all happy ever after.
