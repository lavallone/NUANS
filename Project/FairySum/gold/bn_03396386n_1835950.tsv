2: Fool that I was to plunge with such unsanctioned frensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate; fool or god that he was—my only friend, who led me and went before me, and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be mine!
3: We met, I recall, in a railway station, where he was the center of a crowd of the vulgarly curious.
5: I think he was then approaching forty years of age, for there were deep lines in the face, wan and hollow-cheeked, but oval and actually beautiful; and touches of gray in the thick, waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black.
7: I said to myself, with all the ardor of a sculptor, that this man was a faun's statue out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple's ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years.
8: And when he opened his immense, sunken, and wildly luminous black eyes I knew he would be thenceforth my only friend—the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before—for I saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality; realms which I had cherished in fancy, but vainly sought.
9: So as I drove the crowd away I told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries, and he assented without speaking a word.
11: We talked often in the night, and in the day, when I chiseled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalize his different expressions.
12: Of our studies it is impossible to speak, since they held so slight a connection with anything of the world as living men conceive it.
13: They were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter, time, and space, and whose existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleep—those rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men, and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men.
17: One man with Oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative, and men have laughed.
18: But even that man with Oriental eyes has done no more than suspect.
19: I had wished and tried to do more than suspect, and my friend had tried and partly succeeded.
20: Then we both tried together, and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manor-house in hoary Kent.
22: What I learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be told—for want of symbols or suggestions in any language.
35: There was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into limitless vacum beyond all thought and entity.
38: My friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of virgin aether, and I could see the sinister exultation on his floating, luminous, too-youthful memory-face.
39: Suddenly that face became dim and quickly disappeared, and in a brief space I found myself projected against an obstacle which I could not penetrate.
40: It was like the others, yet incalculably denser; a sticky clammy mass, if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a non-material sphere.
41: I had, I felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed.
45: I can only say that I fainted, and did not stir till he himself recovered and shook me in his frensy for someone to keep away the horror and desolation.
46: That was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream.
47: Awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again.
48: What he had seen, he dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible, even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake.
49: That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed.
50: After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking.
65: We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world.
66: We were aged and weak from our drugs, dissipations, and nervous overstrain, and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snow-white.
68: Then came one January of fog and rain, when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy.
69: My statues and ivory heads were all sold, and I had no means to purchase new materials, or energy to fashion them even had
71: We suffered terribly, and on a certain night my friend sank into a deep-breathing sleep from which I could not awaken him.
86: They have said, I know not for what reason, that I never had a friend; but that art, philosophy, and insanity had filled all my tragic life.
87: The lodgers and police on that night soothed me, and the doctor administered something to quiet me, nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place.
88: My stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and now a fame which I spurn in despair as I sit for hours, bald, gray-bearded, shriveled, palsied, drug-crazed, and broken, adoring and praying to the object they found.
89: For they deny that I sold the last of my statuary, and point with ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold, petrified, and unvocal.
90: It is all that remains of my friend; the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage; a godlike head of such marble as only old Hellas could yield, young with the youth that is outside time, and with beauteous bearded face, curved, smiling lips, Olympian brow, and dense locks waving and poppy-crowned.
91: They say that that haunting memory-face is modeled from my own, as it was at twenty-five; but upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of Attica—HYPNOS.
