4: They are, succinctly, these: My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and about nine months ago, it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission: no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis.
5: It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be arrested by the process.
6: There were other points to be ascertained, but these most excited my curiosity—the last in especial, from the immensely important character of its consequences.
7: In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the "Bibliotheca Forensica," and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marz) of the Polish versions of "Wallenstein" and "Gargantua."
13: For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis.
17: I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited.
20: It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:
21: "My dear P——,
22: "You may as well come now. D—— and F—— are agreed that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very nearly.
23: "Valdemar."
24: I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber.
50: It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L——l, whether he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.
51: He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, "Yes, I wish to be mesmerized"—adding immediately afterward, "I fear you have deferred it too long."
66: After a few experiments, they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance.
70: We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when Dr. F—— went away—that is to say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.76: "M. Valdemar," I said, "are you asleep?"
78: At its third repetition, his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words: "Yes;—asleep now.
79: Do not wake me!—let me die so!"
98: There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.
119: The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question.
120: He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition.
127: It was evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric process.
129: From this period until the close of last week—an interval of nearly seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends.
132: It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles—to so much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.
142: "For God's sake!—quick!—quick!—put me to sleep—or, quick!—waken me!—quick!—I say to you that I am dead!"
147: As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of "dead! dead!"
148: absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once—within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
