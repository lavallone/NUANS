0: THERE was a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all over with gold.
2: One of his neighbours, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties.
3: He desired of her one of them in marriage, leaving to her choice which of the two she would bestow on him.
4: They would neither of them have him, and sent him backwards and forwards from one another, not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man who had a blue beard, and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having already been married to several wives, and nobody ever knew what became of them.
5: Blue Beard, to engage their affection, took them, with the lady their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, with other young people of the neighbourhood, to one of his country seats, where they stayed a whole week.
8: In short, every thing succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue, and that he was a mighty civil gentleman.
9: As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded.
10: About a month afterwards, Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, about affairs of very great consequence, desiring her to divert herself in his absence, to send for her friends and acquaintances, to carry them into the country, if she pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was.
11: ‘Here,’ said he, ‘are the keys of the two great wardrobes, wherein I have my best furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which is not every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments.
13: Open them all; go into all and every one of them, except that little closet, which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a manner that, if you happen to open it, there’s nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment.’
14: She promised to observe, very exactly, whatever he had ordered; when he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey.
20: Being come to the closet-door, she made a stop for some time, thinking upon her husband’s orders, and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it.
21: She then took the little key, and opened it, trembling, but could not at first see anything plainly, because the windows were shut.
22: After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood, on which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged against the walls.
23: (These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after another.)
24: She thought she should have died for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.
26: Having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off, but the blood would not come out; in vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand, the blood still remained, for the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.
27: Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage.
29: Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.
42: ‘You must die, madam,’ said he, ‘and that presently.’
43: ‘Since I must die,’ answered she (looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears), ‘give me some little time to say my prayers.’
65: ‘No, no,’ said he, ‘recommend thyself to God,’ and was just ready to strike At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard made a sudden stop.
66: The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, drawing their swords, ran directly to Blue Beard.
67: He knew them to be his wife’s brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer; so that he ran away immediately to save himself; but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch, when they ran their swords through his body and left him dead.
69: Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate. 70: She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buy captains’ commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the ill time she had passed with Blue Beard.
