0: Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill mountains.
4: At the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager may have descried the light smoke curling up from a village, whose shingle roofs gleam among the trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape.
5: It is a little village of great antiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists in the early times of the province, just about the beginning of the government of the good Peter Stuyvesant (may he rest in peace!)
7: In that same village, and in one of these very houses (which, to tell the precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain, a simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle.
8: He was a descendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous days of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege of Fort Christina.
34: Rip’s sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who was as much henpecked as his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions in idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye, as the cause of his master’s going so often astray.
38: For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third.
47: Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair, and his only alternative to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his wife, was to take gun in hand, and stroll away into the woods.
51: In a long ramble of the kind, on a fine autumnal day, Rip had unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Kaatskill mountains.
58: As he was about to descend he heard a voice from a distance hallooing, “Rip Van Winkle!
63: Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over him; he looked anxiously in the same direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks, and bending under the weight of something he carried on his back.
65: On nearer approach, he was still more surprised at the singularity of the stranger’s appearance.
67: His dress was of the antique Dutch fashion--a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist--several pair of breeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of buttons down the sides, and bunches at the knees.
68: He bore on his shoulders a stout keg, that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach and assist him with the load.
70: As they ascended, Rip every now and then heard long rolling peals, like distant thunder, that seemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft between lofty rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted.
72: Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a small amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the brinks of which, impending trees shot their branches, so that you only caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud.
74: On entering the amphitheatre, new objects of wonder presented themselves.
75: On a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking personages playing at nine-pins.
76: They were dressed in a quaint outlandish fashion: some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in their belts, and most of them had enormous breeches, of similar style with that of the guide’s.
78: They all had beards, of various shapes and colors
88: He even ventured, when no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had much of the flavor of excellent Hollands.
90: One taste provoked another, and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often, that at length his senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head gradually declined, and he fell into a deep sleep.
91: On waking, he found himself on the green knoll from whence he had first seen the old man of the glen.
99: He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean well-oiled fowling-piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel encrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten.
101: Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a squirrel or partridge.
102: He whistled after him and shouted his name, but all in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was to be seen.
116: As he approached the village, he met a number of people, but none whom he knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself acquainted with every one in the country round.
119: The constant recurrence of this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same, when, to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!
146: In place of these, a lean bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens--election--members of Congress--liberty--Bunker’s hill--heroes of seventy-six--and other words, that were a perfect Babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.
149: The orator bustled up to him, and drawing him partly aside, inquired, “on which side he voted?”
153: “Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, “I am a poor, quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the King, God bless him!” : a refugee! hustle him!
180: There was a whisper, also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief; at the very suggestion of which, the self-important man with the cocked hat retired with some precipitation.
181: At this critical moment a fresh comely woman passed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man.
182: She had a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened at his looks, began to cry.
185: “What is your name, my good woman?” asked he.
186: “Judith Gardenier.”
187: “And your father’s name?”
188: “Ah, poor man, his name was Rip Van Winkle; it’s twenty years since he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of since--his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or was carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell.
194: “I am your father!”
195: cried he--“Young Rip Van Winkle once--old Rip Van Winkle now--Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle!”
196: All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for a moment, exclaimed, “Sure enough!
197: it is Rip Van Winkle--it is himself.
213: It was some time before he could get into the regular track of gossip, or could be made to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his torpor.
214: How that there had been a revolutionary war--that the country had thrown off the yoke of old England--and that, instead of being a subject of his majesty George the Third, he was now a free citizen of the United States.
