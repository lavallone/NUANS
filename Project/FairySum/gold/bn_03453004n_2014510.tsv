0: The white man, leaning with both arms over the roof of the little house in the stern of the boat, said to the steersman-- "We will pass the night in Arsat's clearing.
1: It is late."
30: The steersman, pointing with his paddle, said, "Arsat is there.
31: I see his canoe fast between the piles."
40: The big canoe glided on swiftly, noiselessly, and smoothly, towards Arsat's clearing, till, in a great rattling of poles thrown down, and the loud murmurs of "Allah be praised!"
41: it came with a gentle knock against the crooked piles below the house.
42: The boatmen with uplifted faces shouted discordantly, "Arsat!
43: O Arsat!"
44: Nobody came.
45: The white man began to climb the rude ladder giving access to the bamboo platform before the house.
46: The juragan of the boat said sulkily, "We will cook in the sampan, and sleep on the water."
47: "Pass my blankets and the basket," said the white man, curtly.
48: He knelt on the edge of the platform to receive the bundle.
49: Then the boat shoved off, and the white man, standing up, confronted Arsat, who had come out through the low door of his hut.
53: His big, soft eyes stared eagerly at the white man, but his voice and demeanour were composed as he asked, without any words of greeting-- "Have you medicine, Tuan?"
54: "No," said the visitor in a startled tone.
55: "No.
56: Why?
57: Is there sickness in the house?"
58: "Enter and see," replied Arsat, in the same calm manner, and turning short round, passed again through the small doorway.
60: In the dim light of the dwelling he made out on a couch of bamboos a woman stretched on her back under a broad sheet of red cotton cloth.
61: She lay still, as if dead; but her big eyes, wide open, glittered in the gloom, staring upwards at the slender rafters, motionless and unseeing.
62: She was in a high fever, and evidently unconscious.
63: Her cheeks were sunk slightly, her lips were partly open, and on the young face there was the ominous and fixed expression--the absorbed, contemplating expression of the unconscious who are going to die.
71: He remained silent for a minute, then asked softly-- "Tuan, will she die?"
72: "I fear so," said the white man, sorrowfully.
93: Tuan, do you remember the old days?
94: Do you remember my brother?"
95: "Yes," said the white man.
126: Arsat went on with mournful composure-- "Therefore I shall speak to you of love.
130: "After the time of trouble and war was over and you went away from my country in the pursuit of your desires, which we, men of the islands, cannot understand, I and my brother became again, as we had been before, the sword-bearers of the Ruler.
131: You know we were men of family, belonging to a ruling race, and more fit than any to carry on our right shoulder the emblem of power.
132: And in the time of prosperity Si Dendring showed us favour, as we, in time of sorrow, had showed to him the faithfulness of our courage.
133: It was a time of peace.
134: A time of deer-hunts and cock-fights; of idle talks and foolish squabbles between men whose bellies are full and weapons are rusty.
135: But the sower watched the young rice-shoots grow up without fear, and the traders came and went, departed lean and returned fat into the river of peace.
136: They brought news, too.
138: We heard from them about you also.
139: They had seen you here and had seen you there.
140: And I was glad to hear, for I remembered the stirring times, and I always remembered you, Tuan, till the time came when my eyes could see nothing in the past, because they had looked upon the one who is dying there--in the house."
141: He stopped to exclaim in an intense whisper, "O Mara bahia!
142: O Calamity!"
143: then went on speaking a little louder: "There's no worse enemy and no better friend than a brother, Tuan, for one brother knows another, and in perfect knowledge is strength for good or evil.
144: I loved my brother.
145: I went to him and told him that I could see nothing but one face, hear nothing but one voice.
146: He told me: 'Open your heart so that she can see what is in it--and wait.
147: Patience is wisdom.
148: Inchi Midah may die or our Ruler may throw off his fear of a woman!' . . .
149: I waited! .
165: Our time came when the Ruler and all the great people went to the mouth of the river to fish by torchlight.
166: There were hundreds of boats, and on the white sand, between the water and the forests, dwellings of leaves were built for the households of the Rajahs.
167: The smoke of cooking-fires was like a blue mist of the evening, and many voices rang in it joyfully.
168: While they were making the boats ready to beat up the fish, my brother came to me and said, 'To-night!'
173: We could hear the talk of slave-girls amongst the sheds.
174: Then we found a place deserted and silent.
175: We waited there.
177: She came running along the shore, rapid and leaving no trace, like a leaf driven by the wind into the sea.
178: My brother said gloomily, 'Go and take her; carry her into our boat.'
186: We should have taken her in daylight.'
187: I said, 'Let us be off'; for since she was in my boat I began to think of our Ruler's many men.
188: '
214: We passed out of the river; we flew in clear channels amongst the shallows.
215: We skirted the black coast; we skirted the sand beaches where the sea speaks in whispers to the land; and the gleam of white sand flashed back past our boat, so swiftly she ran upon the water.
216: We spoke not.
217: Only once I said, 'Sleep, Diamelen, for soon you may want all your strength.'
242: "We ran our canoe on the white beach of a little bay close to a long tongue of land that seemed to bar our road; a long wooded cape going far into the sea.
243: My brother knew that place.
244: Beyond the cape a river has its entrance, and through the jungle of that land there is a narrow path.
245: We made a fire and cooked rice.
246: Then we lay down to sleep on the soft sand in the shade of our canoe, while she watched.
247: No sooner had I closed my eyes than I heard her cry of alarm.
248: We leaped up.
249: The sun was halfway down the sky already, and coming in sight in the opening of the bay we saw a prau manned by many paddlers.
250: We knew it at once; it was one of our Rajah's praus.
251: They were watching the shore, and saw us.
252: They beat the gong, and turned the head of the prau into the bay.
255: There was no escape by sea.
256: My brother laughed.
257: He had the gun you had given him, Tuan, before you went away, but there was only a handful of powder.
258: He spoke to me quickly: 'Run with her along the path.
259: I shall keep them back, for they have no firearms, and landing in the face of a man with a gun is certain death for some.
260: Run with her.
261: On the other side of that wood there is a fisherman's house--and a canoe.
274: I saw a low hut above the black mud, and a small canoe hauled up.
277: We rushed down to the canoe; a man came running from the hut, but I leaped on him, and we rolled together in the mud.
278: Then I got up, and he lay still at my feet.
280: I and Diamelen pushed the canoe afloat.
281: I heard yells behind me, and I saw my brother run across the glade.
282: Many men were bounding after him, I took her in my arms and threw her into the boat, then leaped in myself.
283: When I looked back I saw that my brother had fallen.
284: He fell and was up again, but the men were closing round him.
285: He shouted, 'I am coming!'
286: The men were close to him.
287: I looked.
288: Many men.
289: Then I looked at her.
290: Tuan, I pushed the canoe!
291: I pushed it into deep water.
292: She was kneeling forward looking at me, and I said, 'Take your paddle,' while I struck the water with mine.
293: Tuan, I heard him cry.
294: I heard him cry my name twice; and I heard voices shouting, 'Kill!
295: Strike!'
296: I never turned back.
297: I heard him calling my name again with a great shriek, as when life is going out together with the voice--and I never turned my head.
301: Three times he called--but I was not afraid of life.
302: Was she not there in that canoe?
303: And could I not with her find a country where death is forgotten--where death is unknown!"
320: His chin rested on his chest, and he murmured sadly without lifting his head-- "We all love our brothers."
321: Arsat burst out with an intense whispering violence-- "What did I care who died?
322: I wanted peace in my own heart."
323: He seemed to hear a stir in the house--listened--then stepped in noiselessly.
324: The white man stood up.
325: A breeze was coming in fitful puffs.
326: The stars shone paler as if they had retreated into the frozen depths of immense space.
327: After a chill gust of wind there were a few seconds of perfect calm and absolute silence.
328: Then from behind the black and wavy line of the forests a column of golden light shot up into the heavens and spread over the semicircle of the eastern horizon.
329: The sun had risen.
332: The white man, standing gazing upwards before the doorway, heard in the hut a confused and broken murmur of distracted words ending with a loud groan.
333: Suddenly Arsat stumbled out with outstretched hands, shivered, and stood still for some time with fixed eyes.
334: Then he said-- "She burns no more."
335: Before his face the sun showed its edge above the tree-tops rising steadily.
339: Arsat's eyes wandered slowly, then stared at the rising sun.
340: "I can see nothing," he said half aloud to himself.
341: "There is nothing," said the white man, moving to the edge of the platform and waving his hand to his boat.
343: "If you want to come with me, I will wait all the morning," said the white man, looking away upon the water.
344: "No, Tuan," said Arsat, softly.
345: "I shall not eat or sleep in this house, but I must first see my road.
346: Now I can see nothing--see nothing!
347: There is no light and no peace in the world; but there is death--death for many.
348: We are sons of the same mother--and I left him in the midst of enemies; but I am going back now."
349: He drew a long breath and went on in a dreamy tone: "In a little while I shall see clear enough to strike--to strike.
350: But she has died, and . . .
351: now . . .
352: darkness."
353: He flung his arms wide open, let them fall along his body, then stood still with unmoved face and stony eyes, staring at the sun.
354: The white man got down into his canoe.
355: The polers ran smartly along the sides of the boat, looking over their shoulders at the beginning of a weary journey.
356: High in the stern, his head muffled up in white rags, the juragan sat moody, letting his paddle trail in the water.
357: The white man, leaning with both arms over the grass roof of the little cabin, looked back at the shining ripple of the boat's wake.
358: Before the sampan passed out of the lagoon into the creek he lifted his eyes.
359: Arsat had not moved.
360: He stood lonely in the searching sunshine; and he looked beyond the great light of a cloudless day into the darkness of a world of illusions.
