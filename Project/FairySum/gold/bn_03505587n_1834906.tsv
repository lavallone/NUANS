0: In the happy times when Fairies existed, there reigned a King who had three daughters.
1: They were young and beautiful, and all three possessed considerable merit; but the youngest was the most amiable and the best beloved.
2: They called her Merveilleuse.
4: The King had some very bad neighbours, who, weary of peace, formed so powerful a league against him, that he was compelled to arm in self-defence.
7: At one time he had taken a city, at another he had won a battle; at length he succeeded in completely routing his enemies, and driving them out of his dominions.
8: He then returned with all speed to the castle to see his little Merveilleuse, of whom he was so fond.
20: A magnificent banquet was served up: the King and his three daughters sat down to table; and as it was his habit to draw inferences from everything, he said to the eldest, "Tell me, pray, why have you put on a green gown?"
21: "Sire," she answered, "having heard of your achievements, I fancied that green would express the joy and hope with which your return inspired me."
22: "That is very prettily said!" exclaimed the King.
23: "And you, my child," he continued; "why do you wear a blue gown?"
24: "My liege," said the Princess, "to indicate that we should unceasingly implore for you the protection of the Gods, and also that the sight of you is to me like that of heaven and all the starry host!"
25: "You speak like an oracle!" said the King.
26: "And you, Merveilleuse; what reason had you for dressing yourself in white?"
29: "My motive was to please you," said the Princess; "it appears to me that I ought to have no other."
31: "There!
32: there!" said he, "I have made an excellent supper.
33: I shall not go to bed yet.
34: Tell me what you all dreamed of the night before my return."
35: The eldest said she dreamed that he had brought her a gown, the gold and jewels of which shone brighter than the sun.
36: The second said she dreamed that he had brought her a golden distaff to spin herself some shifts with.
37: The youngest said she dreamed that he had married her second sister, and that on the wedding-day he held a golden ewer, and said, "Merveilleuse, come hither and wash."
46: He rose in a fury; and though it was not yet daylight, he sent for the captain of his guards, and said to him, "You have heard the dream of Merveilleuse: it prognosticates strange things against me.
47: I command you to seize her immediately, to take her into the forest, and kill her; after which, you will bring me her heart and her tongue, that I may be sure you have not deceived me, or I will have you put to death in the most cruel manner possible."
51: The captain went directly to the Princess's apartment, where he found some difficulty in obtaining admission, for it was still very early.
53: She rose immediately; a little Moorish girl, named Patypata, carried her train.
54: A young ape, and a little dog, who always accompanied her, ran after her.
55: The ape was called Grabugeon, and the little dog, Tintin.
59: It was just getting light: the Princess looked at her conductor; he had tears in his eyes, and was so dejected that he could not speak.
60: "What is the matter?" inquired she in the kindest tone; "you seem very much distressed."
61: "Ah, Madam!" exclaimed he; "who could be otherwise at the most dreadful order that was ever given!
62: The King has commanded me to kill you in this forest, and to take him your heart and your tongue.
63: If I fail to do so he will put me to death."
73: Patypata, who had heard all that had passed, and of whose presence neither the captain of the guards nor the Princess was aware, so absorbed were they in their affliction, advanced boldly, and threw herself at the feet of Merveilleuse.
74: "Madam," said she, "I offer you my life.
75: You must kill me.
76: I shall be too happy to die for so good a mistress."
77: "Oh! I can never permit it, my dear Patypata," said the Princess, kissing her.
79: Grabugeon then stepped forward, and said, "You have reason, Princess, to love so faithful a slave as Patypata; she can be of much more use to you than I. I offer you my tongue and heart with joy, wishing to immortalize myself in the annals of the Empire of Monkeys."
81: "It would be insupportable to me," exclaimed Tintin, "good little dog as I am, should any one
82: but myself
83: lay down their life for my mistress.
84: Either I will die, or nobody shall die."
87: At last, Grabugeon, more hasty than the others, ran up to the very top of a tree, and flinging herself down head foremost, was killed on the spot.
88: Much as the Princess lamented her, she consented, as the poor thing was dead, that the captain of the guards should cut out her tongue; but it was so small, (for altogether the creature was not bigger than one's fist,) that to their great grief they felt convinced the King would not be deceived by it.
91: "It is for me that honour is reserved," interrupted the Moor, snatching up as she spoke the knife that had been used upon Grabugeon, and plunging it into her bosom.
92: The captain of the guards would have taken her tongue, but it was so black that he could not flatter himself he could cheat the king with it.
95: "If you would have accepted my offer," said Tintin, "you would only have had to regret my loss, and I should have had the satisfaction of being the only one regretted."
98: She could not quit the spot till she had buried them in a hole which she found by chance at the foot of a tree, upon which she afterwards scratched these words:—
99: "Three faithful friends lie buried in this grave,
100: Who sacrificed themselves my life to save."
101: She then began to think of her own safety, and as there was none for her in that forest, which was so close to her father's castle that the first person who saw her would recognise her, or where she might be eaten like a chicken by the lions and wolves that infested it, she set off walking as fast as she could.
114: What was her surprise, on arriving in an open space surrounded by trees, to see a large Ram, whiter than snow, whose horns were gilt, who had a garland of flowers round his neck, his legs entwined with ropes of pearls of prodigious size, and chains of diamonds hung about him, and who was reposing on a couch of orange blossoms.
130: "Come, Madam," replied the Ram; "come with me.
131: I offer you one which can be known only to yourself, and you shall be absolute mistress in it."
160: She began to weep, and King Ram, (for so they called him,) who had left her for a few minutes, returning and finding her in tears, was in such despair that he felt he should die at her feet.
162: "Has any one in these dominions been wanting in the respect due to you?"
163: "No," answered she; "I do not complain of any one; I only confess to you that I am unaccustomed to live among the dead, and with sheep that talk.
164: Everything here frightens me, and greatly obliged as I am to you for bringing me hither, I shall be more so if you will take me back into the world."
165: "Do not be alarmed," replied the Ram; "deign to listen to me calmly, and you shall hear my sad history.
166: "I was born to a throne.
172: I was exceedingly fond of hunting, and the eager pursuit of a stag having separated me from my attendants, I suddenly saw him plunge into a pond.
173: I spurred my horse in after him, as imprudently as boldly, but instead of the coldness of the water I felt an extraordinary heat.
174: The pond dried up, and through an opening, out of which issued terrible flames, I fell to the bottom of a precipice, where nothing was to be seen but fire.
175: "I thought myself lost, when I heard a voice which said to me, 'No less fire could warm thy heart, ungrateful one!' 'Hah! who is it that complains of my coldness?' said I. 'An unfortunate who adores thee without hope,' replied the voice.
176: At the same moment the flames were extinguished, and I perceived a Fairy whom I had known from my earliest infancy, and whose age and ugliness had always horrified me.
178: 'What prodigy is this, Ragotte,' said I to her, (so is the Fairy named;) can this really be by your orders?' 'By whose orders should it be?' replied the Fairy.
192: Hadst thou been desperately in love with another,' continued she, 'I would not have interrupted the progress of thy passion; but I had too great an interest in thee not to discover the indifference that reigned in thy heart.
193: 'Well then, love me!'
195: 'Madame Ragotte,' said I to her, 'it is not at the bottom of a pit in which I expected to be roasted that I should think of making a declaration to a person of your merit; I implore you by all the charms that adorn you to set me at liberty, and then we will consider together what can be done for your satisfaction.'
205: "At the same moment she touched me with her wand, and I found myself transformed as you behold me.
206: I have not lost the faculty of speech, nor the sense of affliction which my position occasioned me.
207: 'Thou shalt be a sheep for five years,' said she, 'and absolute master of these beautiful realms, while, far from thee and no longer beholding thy handsome face, I will brood only over the hate I owe thee.'
214: For this reason, I have since avoided the shade of the slave, and during three years have sighed for nothing but my liberty.
215: "In the hope of regaining it, I frequently wander into the forest.
216: There I saw you, beautiful Princess," continued he, "sometimes in a chariot which you drove yourself with more skill than the sun does his own, sometimes following the chase on a steed that seemed as if he would obey no other rider, or contending in the race with the ladies of your court, flying lightly over the plain, you won the prize, like another Atalanta.
217: Ah, Princess, if, during all this time in which my heart paid you its secret homage, I had dared to address you, what should I not have said?
218: But how would you have received the declaration of an unhappy sheep like me?"
220: She said some civil things to him, however, which gave him a little hope, and told him that she was less alarmed at the ghosts now that she knew their owners would revive again.
228: The Princess thus passed her days in peace, awaiting a happier lot.
231: One day, on the arrival of the couriers,—for he regularly sent out for the news, and always had the first and best intelligence,—he learned that the eldest sister of Princess Merveilleuse was about to marry a great prince, and that nothing could be more magnificent than the preparations they were making for the nuptials.
235: "What reason have you to complain, Madam?" said the King of the Sheep; "have I refused you permission to go to the wedding?
236: Depart as soon as you please, only give me your word that you will return.
237: If you do not agree to that, you will see me expire at your feet, for my attachment to you is too violent for me to lose you and live."
238: Merveilleuse, much affected, promised the Ram that nothing in the world should prevent her return.
247: She arrived at her father's court at the moment the marriage was being celebrated.
251: The fear, notwithstanding, that she should be detained, prevented her staying to quite the end of the ceremony.
252: She departed abruptly, leaving a little coral box, garnished with emeralds, and with these words on it, in diamond sparks: "Jewels for the Bride."
262: Some short time afterwards the King married his second daughter.
263: Merveilleuse heard of it, and entreated the Ram to permit her to witness, as before, a fête in which she took so much interest.
274: The ceremony being nearly concluded, the Princess rose hastily that she might disappear in the crowd, but she was extremely surprised and distressed to find that all the gates were locked.
277: He led her into a magnificent saloon, in which all the court were assembled, and offered to her himself a golden basin and a ewer filled with water, that she might wash her beautiful hands.
278: At this, she could no longer suppress her emotions; she flung herself at his feet, and embracing his knees, exclaimed, "Behold, my dream has come true!
279: You have offered me water to wash with on my sister's wedding-day without any evil befalling you."
280: The King recognised her with less difficulty, as he had more than once been struck by her great resemblance to Merveilleuse.
281: "Ah! my dear daughter," said he, embracing her with tears in his eyes, "can you forget my cruelty?
282: I sought your life because I thought your dream prognosticated the loss of my crown.
283: It did so, indeed," continued he, "for here are your two sisters married, and each has a crown of her own, therefore mine shall be yours."
284: So saying, he rose, and placed his crown on the head of the Princess, crying, "Long live Queen Merveilleuse!"
293: But whilst she was thus engrossed by the King and her sisters, the enamoured Ram saw the hour fixed for the return of the Princess pass by, and his anxiety became so extreme that he could not control it.
299: When he reached the King's palace, he asked to see Merveilleuse; but as everybody was now aware of her adventures, and by no means desired that she should return to the realms of the Ram, they harshly refused to admit him to her presence.
301: At length, broken-hearted, he flung himself on the ground, and breathed his last sigh.
303: The King proposed to his daughter to mount a triumphal car, and show herself to all the city by the lights of thousands and thousands of flambeaux which illuminated the windows and all the great squares; but what a horrible spectacle for her, to see, as she issued from the palace-gates, her dear Ram stretched breathless on the pavement!
304: She threw herself from the car, she ran to him, she wept, she groaned, she knew that her unpunctuality had caused the death of the royal Ram.
