0: The Voice in the Night It was a dark, starless night.
1: We were becalmed in the Northern Pacific.
4: The crew, consisting of two men and a boy, were sleeping forward in their den, while Will—my friend, and the master of our little craft—was aft in his bunk on the port side of the little cabin.
5: Suddenly, from out of the surrounding darkness, there came a hail: “Schooner, ahoy!”
6: The cry was so unexpected that I gave no immediate answer, because of my surprise.
8: “Hullo!”
9: I sung out, having gathered my wits somewhat.
10: “What are you?
11: What do you want?”
12: “You need not be afraid,” answered the queer voice, having probably noticed some trace of confusion in my tone.
15: “Why don’t you come alongside, then?”
16: I queried somewhat snappishly; for I liked not his hinting at my having been a trifle shaken.
17: “I—I—can’t.
18: It wouldn’t be safe.
19: I——” The voice broke off, and there was silence.
22: “What’s not safe?
23: Where are you?”
24: I listened for a moment; but there came no answer.
25: And then, a sudden indefinite suspicion, of I knew not what, coming to me, I stepped swiftly to the binnacle and took out the lighted lamp.
26: At the same time, I knocked on the deck with my heel to waken Will.
34: Then I heard Will’s voice from the direction of the after scuttle: “What’s up, George?”
35: “Come here, Will!”
36: I said.
39: I told him the queer thing that had happened.
40: He put several questions; then, after a moment’s silence, he raised his hands to his lips and hailed: “Boat, ahoy!”
42: Presently, after a short period of silence, there grew on our hearing the muffled sound of oars, at which Will hailed again.
43: This time there was a reply: “Put away the light.”
64: “I am sorry—sorry!
65: I would not have troubled you, only I am hungry, and—so is she.”
81: “I dare not come nearer.
82: I dare not even pay you for the— the provisions.”
83: “That’s all right,” said Will, and hesitated.
84: “You’re welcome to as much grub as you can take—” Again he hesitated.
87: “May God, Who understands everything, reward you—” It broke off huskily.
88: “The—the lady?” said Will abruptly.
89: “Is she—” “I have left her behind upon the island,” came the voice.
98: There was a moment’s pause; then it added, in a tone which seemed a merited reproach: “It was because of our want I ventured—because her agony tortured me.”
110: I said, full of many feelings, over which predominated a vast sympathy.
111: “Get a box.
112: We must float off the stuff to him in it.”
113: This we did, propelling it away from the vessel, out into the darkness, by means of a boat hook.
114: In a minute a slight cry from the Invisible came to us, and we knew that he had secured the box.
124: And so the time slipped away—an hour, another, and still Will stayed with me; for the queer adventure had knocked all desire for sleep out of him.
125: The third hour was three parts through when we heard again the sound of oars across the silent ocean.
130: They came to a stop a little distance off the broadside, and the queer voice came again to us through the darkness: “Schooner, ahoy!”
135: “The—lady is grateful now on earth.
136: She will be more grateful soon in—in heaven.”
146: She is with me in believing that tonight’s happenings are under a special ruling, and that it is God’s wish that we should tell to you all that we have suffered since—since—” “Yes?” said Will softly.
147: “Since the sinking of the Albatross.”
150: “She left Newcastle for ’Frisco some six months ago, and hasn’t been heard of since.”
152: “But some few degrees to the North of the line, she was caught in a terrible storm, and dismasted.
153: When the day came, it was found that she was leaking badly, and, presently, it falling to a calm, the sailors took to the boats, leaving—leaving a young lady—my fiancée—and myself upon the wreck.
156: Yet we did not despair, but set to work and constructed a small raft.
158: Then, the vessel being very deep in the water, we got ourselves onto the raft and pushed off.
165: “When the morning came, we found that we were in a sort of great lagoon; but of this we noticed little at the time; for close before us, through the enshrouding mist, loomed the hull of a large sailing vessel.
169: Presently the raft touched against the side of the vessel, and seeing a rope hanging downward, I seized it and began to climb.
170: Yet I had much ado to make my way up, because of a kind of grey, lichenous fungus that had seized upon the rope, and which blotched the side of the ship lividly.
181: Then we would make a search through the vessel together.
185: Here and there, within the cabins themselves, we came across odd patches of that queer fungus; but this, as my sweetheart said, could be cleansed away.
186: “In the end, having assured ourselves that the after portion of the vessel was empty, we picked our ways to the bows, between the ugly grey nodules of that strange growth; and here we made a further search, which told us that there was indeed none aboard but ourselves.
191: “For several days we stayed aboard the ship, without attempting to get to the shore.
193: Yet even thus early we became aware that our lot was even less to be desired than might have been imagined; for though, as a first step, we scraped away the odd patches of growth that studded the floors and walls of the cabins and saloon, yet they returned almost to their original size within the space of twenty-four hours, which not only discouraged us but gave us a feeling of vague unease.
194: “Still we would nor admit ourselves beaten, so set to work afresh, and not only scraped away the fungus but soaked the places where it had been with carbolic, a can-full of which I had found in the pantry.
196: “On the seventh morning, my sweetheart woke to find a small patch of it growing on her pillow, close to her face.
200: When I saw the thing upon her pillow I shuddered, and then and there we agreed to go right out of the ship and see whether we could not fare to make ourselves more comfortable ashore.
203: “The raft was still alongside, but it was too clumsy to guide, and I lowered down a small boat that hung across the stern, and in this we made our way to the shore.
204: Yet, as we drew near to it, I became gradually aware that here the vile fungus, which had driven us from the ship, was growing riot.
208: “At first, it seemed to us that there was no single portion of the surrounding shore which was not hidden beneath the masses of the hideous lichen; yet, in this, I found we were mistaken; for somewhat later, coasting along the shore at a little distance, we descried a smooth white patch of what appeared to be fine sand, and there we landed.
212: “It is difficult to make you understand how cheered we were to find one place that was absolutely free from the growth, and here we deposited our belongings.
213: Then we went back to the ship for such things as it seemed to us we should need.
214: Among other matters, I managed to bring ashore with me one of the ship’s sails, with which I constructed two small tents, which, though exceedingly rough-shaped, served the purposes for which they were intended.
217: “It was on the thumb of her right hand that the growth first showed.
238: We were, all at once, afraid of something worse than death.
261: Then I made a very horrible discovery.
262: One morning, a little before midday, I came off from the ship with a portion of the biscuits which were left.
263: In the mouth of her tent I saw my sweetheart sitting, eating something.
264: “ ‘What is it, my dear?’
266: Yet, on hearing my voice, she seemed confused, and, turning, slyly threw something toward the edge of the little clearing.
268: It was a piece of the grey fungus.
275: Gradually, as she calmed, I got from her the news that she had tried it the preceding day, and—and liked it.
276: I got her to promise on her knees not to touch it again, however great our hunger.
277: After she had promised, she told me that the desire for it had come suddenly, and that, until the moment of desire, she had experienced nothing toward it but the most extreme repulsion.
278: “Later in the day, feeling strangely restless and much shaken with the thing which I had discovered, I made my way along one of the twisted paths—formed by the white, sand-like substance—which led among the fungoid growth.
281: “Suddenly I was called to myself by a queer hoarse sound on my left.
282: Turning quickly I saw that there was movement among an extraordinarily shaped mass of fungus, close to my elbow.
283: It was swaying uneasily, as though it possessed life of its own.
284: Abruptly, as I stared, the thought came to me that the thing had a grotesque resemblance to the figure of a distorted human creature.
285: Even as the fancy flashed into my brain, there was a slight, sickening noise of tearing, and I saw that one of the branchlike arms was detaching itself from the surrounding grey masses, and coming toward me.
286: The head of the thing—a shapeless grey ball, inclined in my direction.
287: I stood stupidly, and the vile arm brushed across my face.
289: There was a sweetish taste upon my lips where the thing had touched me.
290: I licked them, and was immediately filled with an inhuman desire.
291: I turned and seized a mass of the fungus.
292: Then more, and—more.
293: I was insatiable.
311: There was the dip of an oar—another.
312: Then the voice came again, and for the last time, sounding through the slight surrounding mist, ghostly and mournful.
313: “God bless you!
314: Good-bye!”
315: “Good-bye,” we shouted together hoarsely, our hearts full of many emotions.
316: I glanced about me.
317: I became aware that the dawn was upon us.
318: The sun flung a stray beam across the hidden sea; pierced the mist dully, and lit up the receding boat with a gloomy fire.
319: Indistinctly I saw something nodding between the oars.
320: I thought of a sponge—a great, grey nodding sponge— The oars continued to ply.
