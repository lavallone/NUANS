0: You needn't think I'm crazy, Eliot—plenty of others have queerer prejudices than this.
4: I know I'm more nervous than I was when you saw me last year, but you don't need to hold a clinic over it.
9: Maybe you ought to, anyhow, for you kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard I'd begun to cut the Art Club and keep away from Pickman.
10: Now that he's disappeared I go round to the club once in a while, but my nerves aren't what they were.
11: No, I don't know what's become of Pickman, and I don't like to guess.
21: Morbid art doesn't shock me, and when a man has the genius Pickman had I feel it an honour to know him, no matter what direction his work takes.
22: Boston never had a greater painter than Richard Upton Pickman.
25: You know, it takes profound art and profound insight into Nature to turn out stuff like Pickman's.
54: On the contrary, my admiration for him kept growing; for that 'Ghoul Feeding' was a tremendous achievement.
55: As you know, the club wouldn't exhibit it, and the Museum of Fine Arts wouldn't accept it as a gift; and I can add that nobody would buy it, so Pickman had it right in his house till he went.
61: My hero-worship, coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him, made him get very confidential with me; and one evening he hinted that if I were fairly close-mouthed and none too squeamish, he might show me something rather unusual—something a bit stronger than anything he had in the house.
62: 'You know,' he said, 'there are things that won't do for Newbury Street—things that are out of place here, and that can't be conceived here, anyhow.
63: It's my business to catch the overtones of the soul, and you won't find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets on made land.
64: Back Bay isn't Boston—it isn't anything yet, because it's had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits.
66: 'The place for an artist to live is the North End.
67: If any aesthete were sincere, he'd put up with the slums for the sake of the massed traditions.
94: What if I told you that I've got another studio up there, where I can catch the night-spirit of antique horror and paint things that I couldn't even think of in Newbury Street?
97: 'I've got a place that I don't believe three living Nordic men besides myself have ever seen.
104: 'Now, if you're game, I'll take you there tonight.
108: Well, Eliot, there wasn't much for me to do after that harangue but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight.
114: Not long after this Pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian ten-panelled door that looked damnably worm-eaten.
116: Then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to make myself at home.
118: They were his pictures, you know—the ones he couldn't paint or even show in Newbury Street—and he was right when he said he had 'let himself go.'
124: The madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foreground—for Pickman's morbid art was pre-eminently one of demoniac portraiture.
125: These figures were seldom completely human, but often approached humanity in varying degree.
139: By God, man, I verily believe they were alive!
153: By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to see his 'modern studies.'
158: Well, in spite of all this, that next room forced a real scream out of me, and I had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over.
181: My host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio, and I braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases.
188: The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs, and showed the painstaking methods of the artist.
193: There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half-finished monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream—the second I had emitted that night.
198: It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy.
205: Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled up—probably, I thought, a photograph from which Pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance.
206: I reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly I saw Pickman start as if shot.
208: He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence, then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him.
217: After that followed a sharp grating noise, a shouted gibberish from Pickman, and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver, fired spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect.
220: Pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon, cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient well.
227: He led me out of that tangle of alleys in another direction, it seems, for when we sighted a lamp-post we were in a half-familiar street with monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses.
232: I never spoke to him again.
233: Why did I drop him?
238: It was—something I found in my coat the next morning.
239: You know, the curled-up paper tacked to the frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster.
240: That last scare had come while I was reaching to uncurl it, and it seems I had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket.
252: Well—that paper wasn't a photograph of any background, after all.
253: What it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas.
254: It was the model he was using—and its background was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail.
255: But by God, Eliot, it was a photograph from life!
