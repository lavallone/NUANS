0: KEOLA was married with Lehua, daughter of Kalamake, the wise man Molokai, and he kept his dwelling with the father of his wife.
11: Kalamake was a man that spared for nothing, whether to eat or to drink, or to wear; and for all he paid in bright new dollars.
12: "Bright as Kalamake's dollars," was another saying in the Eight Isles.
13: Yet he neither sold, nor planted, nor took hire—only now and then from his sorceries—and there was no source conceivable for so much silver coin.
36: So saying, he put the Bible under the cushion of the sofa so that it was all covered, brought out from the same place a mat of a wonderfully fine texture, and heaped the herbs and leaves on sand in a tin pan.
37: And then he and Keola put on the necklaces, and took their stand upon the opposite corners of the mat.
38: "The time comes," said the warlock; "be not afraid."
39: With that he set flame to the herbs, and began to mutter and wave the branch of palm.
40: At first the light was dim because of the closed shutters; but the herbs caught strongly afire, and the flames beat upon Keola, and the room glowed with the burning; and next the smoke rose and made his head swim and his eyes darken, and the sound of Kalamake muttering ran in his ears.
41: And suddenly, to the mat on which they were standing came a snatch or twitch, that seemed to be more swift than lightning.
42: In the same wink the room was gone, and the house, the breath all beaten from Keola's body.
43: Volumes of sun rolled upon his eyes and head, and he found himself transported to a beach of the sea, under a strong sun, with a great surf roaring: he and the warlock standing there on the same mat, speechless, gasping and grasping at one another, and passing their hands before their eyes.
44: "What was this?" cried Keola, who came to himself the first, because he was the younger, "The pang of it was like death."
45: "It matters not," panted Kalamake.
46: "It is now done."
47: "And, in the name of God, where are we?" cried Keola.
48: "That is not the question," replied the sorcerer.
49: "Being here, we have matter in our hands, and that we must attend to.
50: Go, while I recover my breath, into the borders of the wood, and bring me the leaves of such and such a herb, and such and such a tree, which you will find to grow there plentifully—three handfuls of each.
51: And be speedy.
52: We must be home again before the steamer comes; it would seem strange if we had disappeared."
56: In front of him was a line of palms against the sky; not like the palms of the Eight Islands, but tall and fresh and beautiful, and hanging out withered fans like gold among the green, and he thought in his heart—— "It is strange I should not have found this grove.
84: "We walk here in the broad sun invisible by reason of these charms.
85: Yet they hear us; and therefore it is well to speak softly, as I do."
86: With that he made a circle round the mat with stones, and in the midst he set the leaves.
87: "It will be your part," said he, "to keep the leaves alight, and feed the fire slowly.
88: While they blaze (which is but for a little moment) I must do my errand; and before the ashes blacken, the same power that brought us carries us away.
348: Have you seen a child when he is all alone and has a wooden sword, and fights, leaping and hewing with the empty air?
349: Even so the man-eaters huddled back to back, and heaved up their axes, and laid on, and screamed as they laid on, and behold!
350: no man to contend with them!
351: only here and there Keola saw an axe swinging over against them without hands; and time and again a man of the tribe would fall before it, clove in twain or burst asunder, and his soul sped howling.
352: For awhile Keola looked upon this prodigy like one that dreams, and then fear took him by the midst as sharp as death, that he should behold such doings.
353: Even in that same flash the high chief of the clan espied him standing, and pointed and called out his name.
354: Thereat the whole tribe saw him also, and their eyes flashed, and their teeth clashed.
355: "I am too long here," thought Keola, and ran farther out of the wood and down the beach, not caring whither.
356: "Keola!" said a voice close by upon the empty sand.
357: "Lehua! is that you!"
358: he cried, and gasped, and looked in vain for her; but by the eyesight he was stark alone.
359: "I saw you pass before," the voice answered; "but you would not hear me.
360: Quick!
361: get the leaves and the herbs, and let us free."
362: "You are there with the mat?" he asked.
363: "Here, at your side," said she.
364: And he felt her arms about him.
365: "Quick!
366: the leaves and the herbs, before my father can get back!"
367: So Keola ran for his life, and fetched the wizard fuel; and Lehua guided him back, and set his feet upon the mat, and made the fire.
368: All the time of its burning, the sound of the battle towered out of the wood; the wizards and the man-eaters hard at fight; the wizards, the view-less ones, roaring out aloud like bulls upon a mountain, and the men of the tribe replying shrill and savage out of the terror of their souls.
369: And all the time of the burning, Keola stood there and listened, and shook, and watched how the unseen hands of Lehua poured the leaves.
372: Now, when Keola could see his wife at last he was mighty pleased, and he was mighty pleased to be home again in Molokai and sit down beside a bowl of poi—for they make no poi on board ships, and there was none in the Isle of Voices—and he was out of the body with pleasure to be clean escaped out of the hands of the eaters of men.
374: There was Kalamake left upon the isle.
375: If, by the blessing of God, he could but stick there, all were well; but should he escape and return to Molokai, it would be an ill day for his daughter and her husband.
385: Keola and Lehua took his advice, and gave many dollars to the lepers and the fund.
386: And no doubt the advice must have been good, for from that day to this, Kalamake has never more been heard of.
387: But whether he was slain in the battle by the trees, or whether he is still kicking his heels upon the Isle of Voices, who shall say?
