0: I was shown into the attic chamber by a grave, intelligent-looking man with quiet clothes and an iron-gray beard, who spoke to me in this fashion: "Yes, he lived here—but I don’t advise your doing anything.
7: And I beg of you to let that thing on the table—the thing that looks like a match-box—alone.
10: After a time the man left me alone in the attic room.
21: The small object on the table fascinated me intensely.
22: I seemed to know what to do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light—or what looked like one—out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes.
26: Finally I summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book—then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it.
30: Then I noticed that I was not alone in the room—and put the ray-projector back in my pocket.
33: The newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church.
38: At the present moment—having just lighted a faint oil lamp—he looked nervous, and before I knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room (where the wall slanted sharply) which I had not noticed before.
40: All at once I saw there were others in the room—grave-looking men in clerical costume, one of whom wore the bands and knee-breeches of a bishop.
45: The first-comer then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the table.
47: The procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor, turning and making menacing gestures as they left.
49: The first-comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope.
51: Realizing he was about to hang himself, I started forward to dissuade or save him.
53: He slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark, thin-lipped face.
54: I felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as a weapon of defense.
58: He stopped in his tracks—then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, began to stagger backwards.
61: I found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get there I found no crushed body on the floor below.
62: Instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri-dimensional.
71: When the crowd was gone I saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this place—standing alone with a lantern.
74: He spoke: "So you didn’t let it alone!
81: Something very strange and terrible has happened to you, but it didn’t get far enough to hurt your mind and personality.
94: There’s a mirror up at the other end of the room, and I’m going to take you to it.
97: This is what I saw in the glass: A thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel-bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height.
98: It was the silent first-comer who had burned his books.
