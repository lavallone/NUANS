0: THERE was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named Jack, and a cow named Milky-white.
1: And all they had to live on was the milk the cow gave every morning, which they carried to the market and sold.
2: But one morning Milky-white gave no milk, and they didn't know what to do.
6: "All right, mother," says Jack; "it's market-day today, and I'll soon sell Milky-white, and then we'll see what we can do."
8: He hadn't gone far when he met a funny, looking old man, who said to him: "Good morning, Jack."
15: "As you are so sharp," says he, "I don't mind doing a swop with you—your cow for these beans."
17: "Ah! you don't know what these beans are," said the man; "if you plant them over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky."
22: "Back already, Jack?" said his mother; "I see you haven't got Milky-white, so you've sold her, How much did you get for her?"
28: What do you say to these beans; they're magical, plant them overnight and——" "What!" says Jack's mother, "have you been such a fool, such a dolt, such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans?
34: Not a sup shall you drink, and not a bit shall you swallow this very night."
37: When he woke up, the room looked so funny.
41: Why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden, had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up till it reached the sky.
44: So Jack climbed, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he reached the sky.
45: And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart.
46: So he walked along and he walked along and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman.
48: "Could you be so kind as to give me some breakfast?"
49: For he hadn't had anything to eat you know, the night before and was as hungry as a hunter "It's breakfast you want, is it?" says the great big tall woman, "it's breakfast you'll be if you don't move off from here.
50: My man is an ogre and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast.
51: You'd better be moving on or he'll soon be coming."
53: I've had nothing to eat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum," says Jack, "I may as well be broiled as die of hunger."
55: So she took Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk.
56: But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump!
63: And she bundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in.
64: He was a big one, to be sure.
76: "Wait till he's asleep," says she; "he always has a doze after breakfast."
79: Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold, which of course fell into his mother's garden, and then he climbed down and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed her the gold and said: "Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans?
81: So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came to the end of it, and Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more up at the top of the beanstalk.
86: But aren't you the youngster who came here once before?
87: Do you know, that very day, my man missed one of his bags of gold."
88: "That's strange, mum," said Jack, "I dare say I could tell you something about that, but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to eat."
89: Well the big tall woman was so curious that she took him in and gave him something to eat.
94: All happened as it did before.
99: Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden hen, and was off before you could say "Jack Robinson."
100: But this time the hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got out of the house he heard him calling: "Wife, wife, what have you done with my golden hen?"
102: But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and climbed down like a house on fire.
103: And when he got home he showed his mother the wonderful hen, and said "Lay" to it; and it laid a golden egg every time he said "Lay."
104: Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't very long before he determined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk.
121: After breakfast was over, the ogre called out "Wife, wife, bring me my golden harp."
123: Then he said: "Sing!" and the golden harp sang most beautifully.
124: And it went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.
125: Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door.
126: But the harp called out quite loud: "Master! Master!"
127: and the ogre woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp.
128: Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew where he was going.
134: Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre.
136: So he called out: "Mother!
139: But Jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the beanstalk which cut it half in two.
141: Then Jack gave another chop with the axe, and the beanstalk was cut in two and began to topple over.
142: Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the beanstalk came toppling after.
143: Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that and selling the golden eggs Jack and his mother became very rich, and he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever after.
