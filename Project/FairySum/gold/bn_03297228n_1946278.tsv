0: A locomotive is, next to a marine engine, the most sensitive thing man ever made; and No. .007, besides being sensitive, was new.
2: They had run him into the round-house after his trial—he had said good-bye to his best friend in the shops, the overhead travelling-crane—the big world was just outside; and the other locos were taking stock of him.
4: .007 was an eight-wheeled "American" loco, slightly different from others of his type, and as he stood he was worth ten thousand dollars on the Company's books.
272: Before he knew well what had happened, .007 was flying up the track into the dumb, dark world.
316: Nobody else attended to him, for Evans, the Mogul's engineer, a little cut about the head, but very angry, was exhibiting, by lantern-light, the mangled corpse of a slim blue pig.
319: "Dangerousest beasts they are," said one of the crew.
320: "Get under the pilot an' sort o' twiddle ye off the track, don't they? "
327: The Flying Freight seemed to have flown in every direction, for the Mogul had mounted the rails and run diagonally a few hundred feet from right to left, taking with him such cars as cared to follow.
331: The Mogul himself had waddled into a corn-field, and there he knelt—fantastic wreaths of green twisted round his crank-pins; his pilot covered with solid clods of field, on which corn nodded drunkenly; his fire put out with dirt (Evans had done that as soon as he recovered his senses); and his broken headlight half full of half-burnt moths.
336: A long-bearded man came out of a house beyond the corn-field, and told Evans that if the accident had happened a little later in the year, all his corn would have been burned, and accused Evans of carelessness.
337: Then he ran away, for Evans was at his heels shrieking: "'T was his hog done it—his hog done it!
340: Then the wrecking-crew laughed; and the farmer put his head out of a window and said that Evans was no gentleman.
341: But .007 was very sober.
342: He had never seen a wreck before, and it frightened him.
343: The crew still laughed, but they worked at the same time; and .007 forgot horror in amazement at the way they handled the Mogul freight.
344: They dug round him with spades; they put ties in front of his wheels, and jack-screws under him; they embraced him with the derrick-chain and tickled him with crowbars; while .007 was hitched on to wrecked cars and backed away till the knot broke or the cars rolled clear of the track.
346: By daylight all cars who could move had gone on in charge of another loco; the track was freed for traffic; and .007 had hauled the old Mogul over a small pavement of ties, inch by inch, till his flanges bit the rail once more, and he settled down with a clank.
347: But his spirit was broken, and his nerve was gone.
378: And .007, his hot-box cooled and his experience vastly enlarged, hauled the Mogul freight slowly to the roundhouse.
379: "Hello, old man!
380: Bin out all night, hain't ye?" said the irrepressible Poney, who had just come off duty.
395: "Let me make you two gen'lemen acquainted," said Poney.
396: "This is our Purple Emperor, kid, whom you were admirin' and, I may say, envyin' last night.
397: This is a new brother, worshipful sir, with most of his mileage ahead of him, but, so far as a serving-brother can, I 'll answer for him.'
398: "'Happy to meet you," said the Purple Emperor, with a glance round the crowded round-house.
401: By virtue of the authority vested in me as Head of the Road, I hereby declare and pronounce No. .007 a full and accepted Brother of the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotives, and as such entitled to all shop, switch, track, tank, and round-house privileges throughout my jurisdiction, in the Degree of Superior Flier, it bein' well known and credibly reported to me that our Brother has covered forty-one miles in thirty-nine minutes and a half on an errand of mercy to the afflicted.
402: At a convenient time, I myself will communicate to you the Song and Signal of this Degree whereby you may be recognised in the darkest night.
403: Take your stall, newly entered Brother among Locomotives!"
