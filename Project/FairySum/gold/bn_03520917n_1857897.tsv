6: In the summer and autumn of 1894 I dwelt in the drear expanses of the Cactus Mountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated Norton Mine, whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething cauldron of sordid life.
7: A cavern of gold, lying deep beneath a mountain lake, had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest dreams, and now formed the seat of extensive tunneling operations on the part of the corporation to which it had finally been sold.
11: It was not long after my arrival and employment that Juan Romero came to the Norton Mine.
32: Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite.
34: The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire mountain.
37: Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate it.
38: Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered.
39: Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of their failure.
40: Firmly though respectfully, they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed.
44: The night shift did not go on that evening.
45: At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally.
46: From somewhere within the works a dog barked an answer; either to the coyote— or to something else.
48: It was Romero’s voice, coming from the bunk above, that awakened me, a voice excited and tense with some vague expectation I could not understand: "Madre de Dios!—el sonido—ese sonido —oiga Vd!—lo oye Vd?—señor, THAT SOUND!"
56: Deep, deep, below me was a sound—a rhythm, just as the peon had said—which, though exceedingly faint, yet dominated even the dog, the coyote, and the increasing tempest.
64: Then without apparent volition we began to move toward the door, whose rattling in the gale held a comforting suggestion of earthly reality.
65: The chanting in the depths—for such the sound now seemed to be—grew in volume and distinctness; and we felt irresistibly urged out into the storm and thence to the gaping blackness of the shaft.
69: As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite.
74: It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many wide ladders, broke into a run and left me alone.
76: I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders.
81: Out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive.
84: I had arrived at the abyss, which was now redly aglow, and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero.
89: Chaos supervened, and I knew the peace of oblivion.
91: When I awakened, I was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window.
92: Some distance away the lifeless body of Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, including the camp doctor.
94: No direct cause was evident, and an autopsy failed to show any reason why Romero should not be living.
95: Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither Romero nor I had left the bunk-house during the night; that neither of us had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the Cactus range.
96: That storm, said men who had ventured down the mine shaft, had caused extensive caving-in, and had completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before.
