1: Four-and-thirty years ago, Bob Ainslie and I were coming up Infirmary Street from the High School, our heads together, and our arms intertwisted, as only lovers and boys know how, or why.
2: When we got to the top of the street, and turned north, we espied a crowd at the Tron Church.
3: "A dog-fight!" shouted Bob, and was off; and so was I, both of us all but praying that it might not be over before we got up!
14: Well, Bob and I are up, and find it is not over: a small thoroughbred white bull terrier is busy throttling a large shepherd's dog, unaccustomed to war, but not to be trifled with.
60: Six years have passed,--a long time for a boy and a dog: Bob Ainslie is off to the wars; I am a medical student, and clerk at Minto House Hospital.
61: Rab I saw almost every week, on the Wednesday; and we had much pleasant intimacy.
64: His master I occasionally saw; he used to call me "Maister John," but was laconic as any Spartan.
65: One fine October afternoon, I was leaving the hospital, when I saw the large gate open, and in walked Rab, with that great and easy saunter of his.
67: After him came Jess, now white from age, with her cart, and in it a woman carefully wrapped up,--the carrier leading the horse anxiously, and looking back.
68: When he saw me, James (for his name was James Noble) made a curt and grotesque "boo," and said, "Maister John, this is the mistress; she's got a trouble in her breest,--some kind o' an income, we're thinkin'."
75: She smiled, and made a movement, but said nothing, and prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising.
76: Had Solomon, in all his glory, been handing down the Queen of Sheba at his palace gate, he could not have done it more daintily, more tenderly, more like a gentleman, than did James the Howgate carrier, when he lifted down Ailie his wife.
101: Next day, my master, the surgeon, examined Ailie.
103: It could be removed; it might never return; it would give her speedy relief: she should have it done.
140: For some days Ailie did well.
145: So far well; but four days after the operation my patient had a sudden and long shivering, a "groosin'," as she called it.
150: Ailie got worse; began to wander in her mind, gently; was more demonstrative in her ways to James, rapid in her questions, and sharp at times.
164: One night she had fallen quiet, and, as we hoped, asleep; her eyes were shut.
183: She lay for some time breathing quick, and passed away so gently that, when we thought she was gone, James, in his old-fashioned way, held the mirror to her face.
215: James looked after everything; then rather suddenly fell ill, and took to bed; was insensible when the doctor came, and soon died.
219: And what of Rab?
220: I asked for him next week at the new carrier who got the good-will of James's business and was now master of Jess and her cart.
225: He, getting confused and red, and intermeddling with his hair, said, '"Deed, sir, Rab's deid."
228: "Weel, sir," said he, getting redder, "he didna exactly dee; he was killed.
231: I tempit him wi' kail and meat, but he wad tak' naething, and keepit me fra feedin' the beast, and he was aye gur gurrin', and grup gruppin' me by the legs.
232: I was laith to mak' awa wi' the auld dowg, his like wasna atween this and Thornhill,--but, 'deed, sir, I could do naething else."
234: Fit end for Rab, quick and complete.
235: His teeth and his friends gone, why should he keep the peace and be civil?
236: He was buried in the braeface, near the burn, the children of the village, his companions, who used to make very free with him and sit on his ample stomach as he lay half asleep at the door in the sun, watching the solemnity.
