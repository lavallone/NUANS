0: Pa had sent me out to get an extra pail of air.
1: I'd just about scooped it full and most of the warmth had leaked from my fingers when I saw the thing.
2: You know, at first I thought it was a young lady.
7: We all see things now and then.
10: When I'd recovered the pail and could look again at the opposite apartment, I got an idea of what Ma might be feeling at those times, for I saw it wasn't a young lady at all but simply a light--a tiny light that moved stealthily from window to window, just as if one of the cruel little stars had come down out of the airless sky to investigate why the Earth had gone away from the Sun, and maybe to hunt down something to torment or terrify, now that the Earth didn't have the Sun's protection.
12: I just stood there shaking, and almost froze my feet and did frost my helmet so solid on the inside that I couldn't have seen the light even if it had come out of one of the windows to get me.
13: Then I had the wit to go back inside.
14: Pretty soon I was feeling my familiar way through the thirty or so blankets and rugs Pa has got hung around to slow down the escape of air from the Nest, and I wasn't quite so scared.
38: Pa handled the pail of air in a twist of cloth.
42: Yet it's that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive.
43: It slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the fire.
44: The blankets keep it from escaping too fast.
50: You see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe.
55: Pa says we live better than kings ever did, breathing pure oxygen, but we're used to it and don't notice.
59: I was busting to tell them all about what I'd seen, and so as soon as I'd ducked out of my helmet and while I was still climbing out of my suit, I cut loose.
62: "And you watched this light for some time, son?"
63: he asked when I finished.
66: "Long enough for it to pass five windows and go to the next floor."
67: "And it didn't look like stray electricity or crawling liquid or starlight focused by a growing crystal, or anything like that?"
68: He wasn't just making up those ideas.
69: Odd things happen in a world that's about as cold as can be, and just when you think matter would be frozen dead, it takes on a strange new life.
72: "Not like anything I ever saw," I told him.
73: He stood for a moment frowning.
74: Then, "I'll go out with you, and you show it to me," he said.
108: I don't know what the city looked like in the old days, but now it's beautiful.
109: The starlight lets you see it pretty well--there's quite a bit of light in those steady points speckling the blackness above.
117: Sometimes one of those icicles will catch the light of a star and send it to you so brightly you think the star has swooped into the city.
118: That was one of the things Pa had been thinking of when I told him about the light, but I had thought of it myself first and known it wasn't so.
119: He touched his helmet to mine so we could talk easier and he asked me to point out the windows to him.
120: But there wasn't any light moving around inside them now, or anywhere else.
121: To my surprise, Pa didn't bawl me out and tell me I'd been seeing things.
122: He looked all around quite a while after filling his pail, and just as we were going inside he whipped around without warning, as if to take some peeping thing off guard.
126: Inside, he said to me, touching helmets, "If you see something like that again, son, don't tell the others.
127: Your Ma's sort of nervous these days
128: and we owe her all the feeling of safety we can give her.
142: Something had to be done, and almost before I knew what I was going to say, I heard myself asking Pa to tell us about the old days, and how it all happened.
143: He sometimes doesn't mind telling that story, and Sis and I sure like to listen to it, and he got my idea.
144: So we were all settled around the fire in a wink, and Ma pushed up some cans to thaw for supper, and Pa began.
145: Before he did, though, I noticed him casually get a hammer from the shelf and lay it down beside him.
147: He told us how the Earth had been swinging around the Sun ever so steady and warm, and the people on it fixing to make money and wars and have a good time and get power and treat each other right or wrong, when without warning there comes charging out of space this dead star, this burned out sun, and upsets everything.
157: The dark star, as Pa went on telling it, rushed in pretty fast and there wasn't much time to get ready.
158: At the beginning they tried to keep it a secret from most people, but then the truth came out, what with the earthquakes and floods--imagine, oceans of _unfrozen_
159: water!--and people seeing stars blotted out by something on a clear night.
164: The Sun and the newcomer fought over the Earth for a little while--pulling it this way and that, like two dogs growling over a bone, Pa described it this time--and then the newcomer won and carried us off.
175: We've often asked Pa how people acted during that time, whether they were scared or brave or crazy or stunned, or all four, but he's sort of leery of the subject, and he was again tonight.
176: He says he was mostly too busy to notice.
177: You see, Pa and some scientist friends of his had figured out part of what was going to happen--they'd known we'd get captured and our air would freeze--and they'd been working like mad to fix up a place with airtight walls and doors, and insulation against the cold, and big supplies of food and fuel and water and bottled air.
178: But the place got smashed in the last earthquakes and all Pa's friends were killed then and in the Big Jerk.
179: So he had to start over and throw the Nest together quick without any advantages, just using any stuff he could lay his hands on.
205: There was just the sound of Pa's voice and the clocks.
206: And then, from beyond the blankets, I thought I heard a tiny noise.
226: It seemed to me that the inmost blanket trembled and bulged a little.
234: But then the blanket actually did move and lift.
236: Pa's voice stopped and his eyes turned to the widening slit and his hand went out until it touched and gripped the handle of the hammer beside him.
237: In through the blanket stepped the beautiful young lady.
239: And two other faces peered over her shoulders--men's faces, white and staring.
243: They were simply people, you see.
244: We hadn't been the only ones to survive; we'd just thought so, for natural enough reasons.
245: These three people had survived, and quite a few others with them.
246: And when we found out _how_ they'd survived, Pa let out the biggest whoop of joy.
247: They were from Los Alamos and they were getting their heat and power from atomic energy.
248: Just using the uranium and plutonium intended for bombs, they had enough to go on for thousands of years.
249: They had a regular little airtight city, with air-locks and all.
250: They even generated electric light and grew plants and animals by it.
258: They'd been scouting around for survivors, but they never expected to find any in a place like this.
259: They had rocket ships at Los Alamos and plenty of chemical fuel.
260: As for liquid oxygen, all you had to do was go out and shovel the air blanket at the top _level_.
261: So after they'd got things going smoothly at Los Alamos, which had taken years, they'd decided to make some trips to likely places where there might be other survivors.
262: No good trying long-distance radio signals, of course, since there was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth.
282: And when the newcomers began to talk about our all going to Los Alamos, as if that were taken for granted, I could see that something of the same feeling struck Pa and Ma, too.
283: Pa got very silent all of a sudden and Ma kept telling the young lady, "But I wouldn't know how to act there and I haven't any clothes."
284: The strangers were puzzled like anything at first, but then they got the idea.
285: As Pa kept saying, "It just doesn't seem right to let this fire go out."
286: Well, the strangers are gone, but they're coming back.
290: Of course, now that the strangers are gone, I've been thinking a lot about Los Alamos and those other tremendous colonies.
291: I have a hankering to see them for myself.
292: You ask me, Pa wants to see them, too.
293: He's been getting pretty thoughtful, watching Ma and Sis perk up.
294: "It's different, now that we know others are alive," he explains to me.
295: "Your mother doesn't feel so hopeless any more.
296: Neither do I, for that matter, not having to carry the whole responsibility for keeping the human race going, so to speak.
297: It scares a person."  I looked around at the blanket walls and the fire and the pails of air boiling away and Ma and Sis sleeping in the warmth and the flickering light.
304: "The trouble with the world was that it kept getting smaller and smaller, till it ended with just the Nest.
305: Now it'll be good to have a real huge world again, the way it was in the beginning."
