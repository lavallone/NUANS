0: By THE light of a tallow candle, which had been placed on one end of a rough table, a man was reading something written in a book.
1: It was an old account book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently, very legible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of the candle to get a stronger light upon it.
2: The shadow of the book would then throw into obscurity a half of the room, darkening a number of faces and figures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present.
3: Seven of them sat against the rough log walls, silent and motionless, and, the room being small, not very far from the table.
4: By extending an arm any one of them could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the table, face upward, partly covered by a sheet, his arms at his sides.
5: He was dead.
6: The man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all seemed to be waiting for something to occur; the dead man only was without expectation.
10: The person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him that he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his attire which attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his environment.
12: In countenance the man was rather prepossessing, with just a hint of sternness; though that he may have assumed or cultivated, as appropriate to one in authority.
13: For he was a coroner.
14: It was by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which he was reading; it had been found among the dead man's effects--in his cabin, where the inquest was now taking place.
15: When the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast pocket.
19: He had, in fact, been riding hard to attend the inquest.
20: The coroner nodded; no one else greeted him.
21: "We have waited for you," said the coroner.
22: "It is necessary to have done with this business to-night."
25: "I went away, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account of what I suppose I am called back to relate."
26: The coroner smiled.
27: "The account that you posted to your newspaper," he said, "differs probably from that which you will give here under oath."
30: It was not written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction.
34: The coroner was apparently not greatly affected by the young man's manifest resentment.
35: He was silent for some moments, his eyes upon the floor.
36: The men about the sides of the cabin talked in whispers, but seldom withdrew their gaze from the face of the corpse.
37: Presently the coroner lifted his eyes and said: "We will resume the inquest."
39: The witness was sworn.
41: the coroner asked.
42: "William Harker."
44: "You knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?"
46: "You were with him when he died?"
47: "Near him."
48: "How did that happen--your presence, I mean?"
49: "I was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish.
53: "I sometimes read them."
55: "Stories in general--not yours."
58: Soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily, and a jest in the death chamber conquers by surprise.
59: "Relate the circumstances of this man's death," said the coroner.
60: "You may use any notes or memoranda that you please."
61: The witness understood.
62: Pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket he held it near the candle, and turning the leaves until he found the passage that he wanted, began to read.
65: Morgan said that our best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out, and we crossed it by a trail through the _chaparral_.
67: As we emerged from the _chaparral_, Morgan was but a few yards in advance.
68: Suddenly, we heard, at a little distance to our right, and partly in front, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we could see were violently agitated.
71: "Morgan, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated chaparral, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of his gun, and was holding it in readiness to aim.
75: 'You are not going to fill up a deer with quail-shot, are you?'
76: "Still he did not reply; but, catching a sight of his face as he turned it slightly toward me, I was struck by the pallor of it.
78: I advanced to Morgan's side, cocking my piece as I moved.
79: "The bushes were now quiet, and the sounds had ceased, but Morgan was as attentive to the place as before.
81: What the devil is it?'
83: "'That Damned Thing!'
84: he replied, without turning his head.
85: His voice was husky and unnatural.
86: He trembled visibly.
93: It was a mere falsification of the law of aerial perspective, but it startled, almost terrified me.
96: My companion appeared actually frightened, and I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his gun to his shoulders and fire both barrels at the agitated grass!
97: Before the smoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage cry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, flinging his gun upon the ground, Morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot.
98: At the same instant I was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something unseen in the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown against me with great force.
99: "Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to have been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in mortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds as one hears from fighting dogs.
100: Inexpressibly terrified, I struggled to my feet and looked in the direction of Morgan's retreat; and may heaven in mercy spare me from another sight like that!
101: At a distance of less than thirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown back at a frightful angle, hatless, his long hair in disorder and his whole body in violent movement from side to side, backward and forward.
103: The other arm was invisible.
104: At times, as my memory now reports this extraordinary scene, I could discern but a part of his body; it was as if he had been partly blotted out--I can not otherwise express it--then a shifting of his position would bring it all into view again.
105: "All this must have occurred within a few seconds, yet in that time Morgan assumed all the postures of a determined wrestler vanquished by superior weight and strength.
106: I saw nothing but him, and him not always distinctly.
107: During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard, as if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I had never heard from the throat of man or brute!
108: "For a moment only I stood irresolute, then, throwing down my gun, I ran forward to my friend's assistance.
109: I had a vague belief that he was suffering from a fit or some form of convulsion.
110: Before I could reach his side he was down and quiet.
111: All sounds had ceased, but, with a feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I now saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of a wood.
112: It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to withdraw my eyes and look at my companion.
113: He was dead."
114: The coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man.
117: The chest and sides looked as if they had been beaten with a bludgeon.
118: There were dreadful lacerations; the skin was torn in strips and shreds.
119: The coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk handkerchief, which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the top of the head.
121: Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better view repented their curiosity, and turned away their faces.
122: Witness Harker went to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and sick.
123: Dropping the handkerchief upon the dead man's neck, the coroner stepped to an angle of the room, and from a pile of clothing produced one garment after another, each of which he held up a moment for inspection.
124: All were torn, and stiff with blood.
127: They had, in truth, seen all this before; the only thing that was new to them being Harker's testimony.
128: "Gentlemen," the coroner said, "we have no more evidence, I think.
131: "I should like to ask one question, Mr. Coroner," he said.
132: "What asylum did this yer last witness escape from?"
133: "Mr. Harker," said the coroner, gravely and tranquilly, "from what asylum did you last escape?"
134: Harker flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven jurors rose and solemnly filed out of the cabin.
135: "If you have done insulting me, sir," said Harker, as soon as he and the officer were left alone with the dead man, "I suppose I am at liberty to go?"
136: "Yes."  Harker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.
138: He turned about and said:  "The book that you have there--I recognize it as Morgan's diary.
139: You seemed greatly interested in it; you read in it while I was testifying.
142: "The book will cut no figure in this matter," replied the official, slipping it into his coat pocket; "all the entries in it were made before the writer's death."
143: As Harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the table on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp definition.
144: The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced from his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather laboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort all signed:  "We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits."
145: In the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries having, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions.
146: At the inquest upon his body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought it not worth while to confuse the jury.
148: At last he ran away into the brush as fast as he could go.
149: I thought at first that he had gone mad, but on returning to the house found no other alteration in his manner than what was obviously due to fear of punishment.
159: "Sept. 27.--It has been about here again--I find evidences of its presence every day.
167: God hates a coward....
168: "Oct. 5.--I can stand it no longer; I have invited Harker to pass a few weeks with me--he has a level head.
169: I can judge from his manner if he thinks me mad.
180: There must have been a signal of warning or command, high and shrill above the din, but by me unheard.
189: the Damned Thing is of such a color!"
