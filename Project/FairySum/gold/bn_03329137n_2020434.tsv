0: Once on a time there was a poor couple who had a son whose name was Halvor.
3: Well, one day a skipper came and asked Halvor if he hadn't a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands.
4: Yes, Halvor would like that very much; so he wasn't long in getting himself ready.
5: How long they sailed I'm sure I can't tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn't tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about.
10: So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat corn-fields and rich meads, but he couldn't catch a glimpse of a living soul.
12: So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it.
13: Halvor followed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone.
14: So as he had now walked the whole day and hadn't taken a bit to eat with him; he was as hungry as a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the more afraid he got.
17: So when Halvor had stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat a Princess who span upon a spinning-wheel.
24: When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that; hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up.
25: "Oh!" said the Princess, "now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."
26: So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo!
27: just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing.
30: "Ay," said Halvor, "you'll soon know that to your cost," and with that he hewed off all his heads.
31: Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said,— "Would my sisters were free too!"
36: So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of gray dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day.
37: When he first saw the castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen.
44: But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey.
49: Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door.
51: But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in.
54: It was a long way to the castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the castle,
56: There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there wag no end to her loveliness.
60: So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it.
64: That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it.
68: Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see.
70: "You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and unscathed, if you will only follow our advice," said the Princesses.
72: So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king's son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure not to take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he'd never see them more.
73: "If I only stood at home I'd be glad," said Halvor; and it was done as he had wished.
75: Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got so afraid they began to bow and scrape.
88: A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on Halvor's face, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once.
95: Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at Halvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty.
99: Up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the Princesses, and much was made of them, but they wouldn't stop there.
100: "No; we want to go down to your father and mother," they said to Halvor; "
105: Yes, Halvor laid his head on her lap, and so she combed his bonny locks, and it wasn't long before Halvor fell fast asleep.
106: Then she took the ring from his finger, and put another in its stead; and so she said,— "Now hold me all together!
107: and now would we were all in Soria Moria Castle."
108: So when Halvor woke up, he could very well tell that he had lost the Princesses, and began to weep and wail; and he was so downcast, 118: So he rode and walked, and walked and rode the whole day through the wide wood, where there were so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and lovely between the trees.
121: But at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming away through the trees.
123: When he got up to it, he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old couple inside.
132: So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the treetops, the old wife went out.
133: "Thou Moon, Thou Moon," she screamed, "canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"
134: "No," said the Moon, "that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."
135: "Wait a bit still," said the old wife to Halvor, "by and by comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."
147: "Yes, I know it very well," said the West Wind, "and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."
155: So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them.
157: So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor.
162: "Ay, ay, here is the right one after all," said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor.
