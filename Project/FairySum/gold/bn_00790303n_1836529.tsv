0: CHILDE Rowland and his brothers twain
1: Were playing at the ball.
2: And there was their sister Burd Ellen
8: Burd Ellen round about the aisle
9: To seek the ball is gone,
11: And she came not back again.
18: She is now in the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland; it would take the boldest knight in Christendom to bring her back."
21: The eldest brother of Burd Ellen was not to be put off, by any fear of danger, from attempting to get her back, so he begged the Warlock Merlin to tell him what he should do, and what he should not do, in going to seek his sister.
22: And after he had been taught, and had repeated his lesson, he set out for Elfland.
26: For he came not back again.
27: Then the second brother got tired and tired of waiting, and he went to the Warlock Merlin and asked him the same as his brother.
28: So he set out to find Burd Ellen.
32: For he came not back again.
33: And when they had waited and waited a good long time, Childe Rowland, the youngest of Burd Ellen's brothers, wished to go, and went to his mother, the good queen, to ask her to let him go.
35: But he begged, and he begged, till at last the good queen let him go, and gave him his father's good brand that never struck in vain, and as she girt it round his waist, she said the spell that would give it victory.
37: "Once more, and but once more," he said to the Warlock, "tell how man or mother's son may rescue Burd Ellen and her brothers twain," "Well, my son," said the Warlock Merlin, "there are but two things, simple they may seem, but hard they are to do.
39: And the thing to do is this: after you have entered the land of Fairy, whoever speaks to you, till you meet the Burd Ellen, you must out with your father's brand and off with their head.
40: And what you've not to do is this: bite no bit, and drink no drop, however hungry or thirsty you be; drink a drop, or bite a bit, while in Elfland you be and never will you see Middle Earth again."
41: So Childe Rowland said the two things over and over again, till he knew them by heart, and he thanked the Warlock Merlin and went on his way.
42: And he went along, and along, and along, and still further along, till he came to the horse-herd of the King of Elfland feeding his horses.
44: "Canst thou tell me," said Childe Rowland to the horse-herd, "where the King of Elfland's Dark Tower is?"
45: "I cannot tell thee," said the horseherd, "but go on a little further and thou wilt come to the cow-herd, and he, maybe, can tell thee."
46: Then, without a word more, Childe Rowland drew the good brand that never struck in vain, and off went the horse-herd's head, and Childe Rowland went on further, till he came to the cow-herd, and asked him the same question.
48: Then Childe Rowland out with his good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the cow-herd's head.
49: And he went on a little further, till he came to an old woman in a grey cloak, and he asked her if she knew where the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland was.
50: "Go on a little further," said the hen-wife, "till you come to a round green hill, surrounded with terrace-rings, from the bottom to the top; go round it three times 'widershins,' and each time say:
51: "Open, door! open, door!
52: And let me come in."
54: And Childe Rowland was just going on, when he remembered what he had to do; so he out with the good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the hen-wife's head Then he went on, and on, and on, till he came to the round green hill with the terrace-rings from top to bottom, and he went round it three times, "widershins," saying each time:
55: And the third time the door did open, and he went in, and it closed with a click, and Childe Rowland was left in the dark.
69: The hall was furnished in a manner equally grand, and at one end of it was a glorious couch of velvet, silk and gold, and there sate Burd Ellen, combing her golden hair with a silver comb.
81: Then they sate down together, and Childe Rowland told her all that he had done, and she told him how their two brothers had reached the Dark Tower, but had been enchanted by the King of Elfland, and lay there entombed as if dead.
82: And then after they had talked a little longer Childe Rowland began to feel hungry from his long travels, and told his sister Burd Ellen how hungry he was and asked for some food, forgetting all about the Warlock Merlin's warning.
83: Burd Ellen looked at Childe Rowland sadly, and shook her head, but she was under a spell, and could not warn him.
84: So she rose up, and went out, and soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk.
85: Childe Rowland was just going to raise it to his lips, when he looked at his sister and remembered why he had come all that way.
86: So he dashed the bowl to the ground, and said: "Not a sup will I swallow, nor a bit will I bite, till Burd Ellen is set free."
92: And then the folding-doors of the hall were burst open, and the King of Elfland rushed in.
95: They fought and they fought, and they fought, till Childe Rowland beat the King of Elfland down on to his knees, and caused him to yield and beg for mercy.
96: "I grant thee mercy," said Childe Rowland; "release my sister from thy spells and raise my brothers to life, and let us all go free, and thou shalt be spared."
100: So they reached home, and the good queen their mother and Burd Ellen never went round a church "widershins" again.
