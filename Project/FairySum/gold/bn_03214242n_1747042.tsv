0: Into the north window of my chamber glows the Pole Star with uncanny light.
4: Just before dawn Arcturus winks ruddily from above the cemetery on the low hillock, and Coma Berenices shimmers weirdly afar off in the mysterious east; but still the Pole Star leers down from the same place in the black vault, winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey.
6: Well do I remember the night of the great Aurora, when over the swamp played the shocking coruscations of the daemon-light.
7: After the beams came clouds, and then I slept.
8: And it was under a horned waning moon that I saw the city for the first time.
9: Still and somnolent did it lie, on a strange plateau in a hollow betwixt strange peaks.
10: Of ghastly marble were its walls and its towers, its columns, domes, and pavements.
13: And overhead, scarce ten degrees from the zenith, glowed that watching Pole Star.
16: Forms strangely robed, but at once noble and familiar, walked abroad, and under the horned waning moon men talked wisdom in a tongue which I understood, though it was unlike any language I had ever known.
18: When I awaked, I was not as I had been.
20: Thereafter, on the cloudy nights when I could sleep, I saw the city often; sometimes under that horned waning moon, and sometimes under the hot yellow rays of a sun which did not set, but which wheeled low around the horizon.
21: And on the clear nights the Pole Star leered as never before.
23: At first content to view the scene as an all-observant uncorporeal presence, I now desired to define my relation to it, and to speak my mind amongst the grave men who conversed each day in the public squares.
25: One night as I listened to the discourse in the large square containing many statues, I felt a change; and perceived that I had at last a bodily form.
26: Nor was I a stranger in the streets of Olathoë, which lies on the plateau of Sarkis, betwixt the peaks Noton and Kadiphonek.
28: That night had the news come of Daikos’ fall, and of the advance of the Inutos; squat, hellish, yellow fiends who five years ago appeared out of the unknown west to ravage the confines of our kingdom, and finally to besiege our towns.
29: Having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains, their way now lay open to the plateau, unless every citizen could resist with the strength of ten men.
31: Alos, my friend, was commander of all the forces of the plateau, and in him lay the last hope of our country.
32: On this occasion he spoke of the perils to be faced, and exhorted the men of Olathoë, bravest of the Lomarians, to sustain the traditions of their ancestors, who when forced to move southward from Zobna before the advance of the great ice-sheet (even as our descendants must some day flee from the land of Lomar), valiantly and victoriously swept aside the hairy, long-armed, cannibal Gnophkehs that stood in their way.
35: To the watch-tower of Thapnen he sent me, there to serve as the eyes of our army.
37: Alone I mounted the tower, for every man of stout body was needed in the passes below.
40: And through an opening in the roof glittered the pale Pole Star, fluttering as if alive, and leering like a fiend and tempter.
41: Methought its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over:
53: My head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next I looked up it was in a dream; with the Pole Star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dream-swamp.
58: I have failed in my duty and betrayed the marble city of Olathoë; I have proven false to Alos, my friend and commander.
59: But still these shadows of my dream deride me.
61: And as I writhe in my guilty agony, frantic to save the city whose peril every moment grows, and vainly striving to shake off this unnatural dream of a house of stone and brick south of a sinister swamp and a cemetery on a low hillock; the Pole Star, even and monstrous, leers down from the black vault, winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey.
