0: WE are scattered now, the friends of the late Mr. Oliver Offord; but whenever we chance to meet I think we are conscious of a certain esoteric respect for each other.
4: Mr. Offord, the most agreeable, the most lovable of bachelors, was a retired diplomatist, living on his pension, confined by his infirmities to his fireside and delighted to be found there any afternoon in the year by such visitors as Brooksmith allowed to come up.
5: Brooksmith was his butler and his most intimate friend, to whom we all stood, or I should say sat, in the same relation in which the subject of the sovereign finds himself to the prime minister.
11: I remember vividly every element of the place, down to the intensely Londonish look of the grey opposite houses, in the gap of the white curtains of the high windows, and the exact spot where, on a particular afternoon, I put down my tea-cup for Brooksmith, lingering an instant, to gather it up as if he were plucking a flower.
12: Mr. Offord's drawing-room was indeed Brooksmith's garden, his pruned and tended human parterre, and if we all flourished there and grew well in our places it was largely owing to his supervision.
22: When I am reminded by some uncomfortable contrast of to-day how perfectly we were all handled there I ask myself once more what had been the secret of such perfection.
36: These speculations couldn't fail to lead me to the fundamental truth that Brooksmith had been somehow at the bottom of the mystery.
37: If he had not established the salon at least he had carried it on.
38: Brooksmith, in short, was the artist!
42: I saw on the spot that though he had plenty of school he carried it without arrogance—he had remained articulate and human.
43: L'Ecole Anglaise, Mr. Offord used to call him, laughing, when, later, it happened more than once that we had some conversation about him.
54: "He thinks me rather mad, but I've broken him in, and now he likes the place, he likes the company," said the old man.
55: I embraced this fully after I had become aware that Brooksmith's main characteristic was a deep and shy refinement, though I remember I was rather puzzled when, on another occasion, Mr. Offord remarked: "What he likes is the talk—mingling in the conversation."
56: I was conscious that I had never seen Brooksmith permit himself this freedom, but I guessed in a moment that what Mr. Offord alluded to was a participation more intense than any speech could have represented—that of being perpetually present on a hundred legitimate pretexts, errands, necessities, and breathing the very atmosphere of criticism, the famous criticism of life.
76: The first day Mr. Offord's door was closed was therefore a dark date in contemporary history.
80: When I did understand that the old man had given up, for the first time, though only for the occasion, I exclaimed dolefully: "What a difference it will make—and to how many people!"
81: "I shall be one of them, sir!" said Brooksmith; and that was the beginning of the end.
95: At last it came to be the case that we all found the closed door more often than the open one; but even when it was closed Brooksmith managed a crack for me to squeeze through; so that practically I never turned away without having paid a visit.
96: The difference simply came to be that the visit was to Brooksmith.
130: His aspect for several days after the expected event may be imagined, and the multiplication by funereal observance of the things he didn't say.
201: Six months later, however, I was favoured with a visit from an elderly, dreary, dingy person, who introduced herself to me as Mr. Brooksmith's aunt and from whom I learned that he was out of place and out of health and had allowed her to come and say to me that if I could spare half-an-hour to look in at him he would take it as a rare honour.
202: I went the next day—his messenger had given me a new address—and found my friend lodged in a short sordid street in Marylebone, one of those corners of London that wear the last expression of sickly meanness.
206: He had passed through an illness and was convalescent, and his mother, as well as his aunt, was in attendance on him.
213: He assured me that he was really getting better, and his mother remarked that he would come round if he could only get his spirits up.
224: A whole year after my visit to him I became aware once, in dining out, that Brooksmith was one of the several servants who hovered behind our chairs.
225: He had not opened the door of the house to me, and I had not recognised him in the cluster of retainers in the hall.
242: Often and often, in dining out, I looked for him, sometimes accepting invitations on purpose to multiply the chances of my meeting him.
244: At last I gave up hope, and one day, at the end of three years, I received another visit from his aunt.
246: Her sister, Mrs. Brooksmith, had been dead a year, and three months later her nephew had disappeared.
250: He had gone out to wait one evening, as usual, in a white waistcoat she had done up for him with her own hands, being due at a large party up Kensington way.
251: But he had never come home again, and had never arrived at the large party, or at any party that any one could make out.
252: No trace of him had come to light—no gleam of the white waistcoat had pierced the obscurity of his doom.
253: This news was a sharp shock to me, for I had my ideas about his real destination.
