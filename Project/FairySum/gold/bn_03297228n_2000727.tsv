0: A locomotive is, next to a marine engine, the most sensitive thing man ever made; and No. .007, besides being sensitive, was new.
4: .007 was an eight-wheeled "American" loco, slightly different from others of his type, and as he stood he was worth ten thousand dollars on the Company's books.
86: Hot-box!
88: that's what Comanche is."
89: Then .007 put both drivers and his pilot into it, as the saying is, for he asked what sort of thing a hot-box might be?
93: Here's an eight-wheel coupled 'American' don't know what a hot-box is!
94: Never heard of an emergency-stop either, did ye?
99: "A hot-box," began the Compound, picking and choosing her words as though they were coal, "a hotbox is the penalty exacted from inexperience by haste.
102: "It 's the price you pay for going on the tear.
104: It 's a disease that don't attack shorthaulers, as a rule."
295: That 's—" A burning pain shot through .007's right rear driver—a crippling, stinging pain.
296: "This," said .007, as he flew, "is a hot-box.
297: Now I know what it means.
310: "That must be the emergency-stop that Poney guyed me about," he gasped, as soon as he could think. "
311: —emergency-stop.
313: He was halted, all hissing hot, a few feet in the rear of what doctors would call a compound-comminuted car.
314: His engineer was kneeling down among his drivers, but he did not call .007 his "Arab steed," nor cry over him, as the engineers did in the newspapers.
315: He just bad-worded .007, and pulled yards of charred cotton-waste from about the axles, and hoped he might some day catch the idiot who had packed it.
316: Nobody else attended to him, for Evans, the Mogul's engineer, a little cut about the head, but very angry, was exhibiting, by lantern-light, the mangled corpse of a slim blue pig.
317: "T were n't even a decent-sized hog," he said.
318: "'T were a shote."
336: A long-bearded man came out of a house beyond the corn-field, and told Evans that if the accident had happened a little later in the year, all his corn would have been burned, and accused Evans of carelessness.
337: Then he ran away, for Evans was at his heels shrieking: "'T was his hog done it—his hog done it!
338: Let me kill him!
340: Then the wrecking-crew laughed; and the farmer put his head out of a window and said that Evans was no gentleman.
345: By dawn thirty or forty men were at work, replacing and ramming down the ties, gauging the rails and spiking them.
346: By daylight all cars who could move had gone on in charge of another loco; the track was freed for traffic; and .007 had hauled the old Mogul over a small pavement of ties, inch by inch, till his flanges bit the rail once more, and he settled down with a clank.
347: But his spirit was broken, and his nerve was gone.
348: "'T were n't even a hog," he repeated dolefully; "'t were a shote; and you—you of all of 'em—had to help me on."
378: And .007, his hot-box cooled and his experience vastly enlarged, hauled the Mogul freight slowly to the roundhouse.
394: It was the Purple Emperor, with his high, tight, plate-glass cab and green velvet cushion, waiting to be cleaned for his next day's fly.
395: "Let me make you two gen'lemen acquainted," said Poney.
396: "This is our Purple Emperor, kid, whom you were admirin' and, I may say, envyin' last night.
397: This is a new brother, worshipful sir, with most of his mileage ahead of him, but, so far as a serving-brother can, I 'll answer for him.'
398: "'Happy to meet you," said the Purple Emperor, with a glance round the crowded round-house.
401: By virtue of the authority vested in me as Head of the Road, I hereby declare and pronounce No. .007 a full and accepted Brother of the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotives, and as such entitled to all shop, switch, track, tank, and round-house privileges throughout my jurisdiction, in the Degree of Superior Flier, it bein' well known and credibly reported to me that our Brother has covered forty-one miles in thirty-nine minutes and a half on an errand of mercy to the afflicted.
402: At a convenient time, I myself will communicate to you the Song and Signal of this Degree whereby you may be recognised in the darkest night.
403: Take your stall, newly entered Brother among Locomotives!"
