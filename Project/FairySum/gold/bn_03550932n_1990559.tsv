0: Truly the wise man said well, that a command of gall cannot be obeyed like one of sugar.
3: There lived, it is said, once upon a time a King of Rough-Rock, who had a wife the very mother of beauty; but in the full career of her years, she fell from the horse of health and broke her life.
5: Goods used to be sold thus in this country, by what was called 'inch of candle.', she called her husband and said to him, "I know you have always loved me tenderly; show me therefore at the close of my days the completion of your love, by promising me never to marry again, unless you find a woman as beautiful as I have been; otherwise I leave you my curse, and shall bear you hatred even in the other world."
6: The king, who loved his wife beyond measure, hearing this her last wish, burst into tears, and for some time could not answer a single word.
7: At last, when he had done weeping, he said to her, "Sooner than take another wife, may the gout lay hold on me, may I have my head cut off like a mackarelSia fatto comm' a starace.
9: My dearest love, drive such a thought from your mind; do not believe in dreams, or that I could love any other woman; you were the first new coat of my love, and you shall carry away with you the last rags of my affection."
10: As he said these words, the poor young queen, who had the death-rattle in her throat, turned up her eyes and stretched out her feet.
11: When the king saw her life thus running out, he unstopped the channels of his eyes, and made such a howling and beating and outcry, that all the Court came running up, calling on the name of the dear soul, and upbraiding Fortune for taking her from him; and plucking out his beard, he cursed the stars, that had sent him such a misfortune.
12: But bearing in mind the maxim, "Pain in one's elbow and pain for one's wife are alike hard to bear, but are soon over," ere the Night had gone forth into the place-of-arms in the sky to muster the bats, he began to count upon his fingers and to reflect thus to himself: "Here is my wife dead, and I am left a wretched widower, with no hope of seeing any one but this poor daughter whom she has left me.
13: I must therefore try to discover some means or other of having a son and heir.
15: where shall I find a woman equal in beauty to my wife?
18: Alas, in what a labyrinth has she put me, in what a perplexity has the promise I made her left me!
20: I am running away before I have seen the wolf; let me open eyes and ears and look about: may there not be some other she-ass in Nardella's stable?
23: So saying he forthwith issued a proclamation and command by Master Chiommiento, that all the handsome women in the world should come to the   of beauty, for he would take the most beautiful to wife and endow her with a kingdom.
25: When the town was thus filled with women, the king had them all drawn up in a line; and he walked up and down, from top to bottom, like a baboon that is never still; and as he examined and measured each from head to foot, one appeared to him wry-browed, another long-nosed, another broad-mouthed, another thick-lipped, another tall as a maypole, another short and dumpy, another too stout, another too slender; the Spaniard did not please him on account of her dark colour, the Neapolitan was not to his fancy on account of her waddling gait, the German appeared cold and icy, the Frenchwoman frivolous and giddy, the Venetian with her light hair looked like a distaff of flax.
26: At the end of the end, one for this cause and another for that, he sent them all away, with one hand before and the other behind; and seeing that so many fair faces were all show and no wool, he turned his thoughts to his own daughter, saying, "Why do I go seeking Maria at Ravenna, when my daughter Preziosa is formed in the same mould of beauty as her mother?
28: When Preziosa heard this, she retired to her chamber, and bewailing her ill fortune, she did not leave a hair upon her head; and whilst she was lamenting thus, an old woman came to her, who was her confidant.
29: As soon as she saw Preziosa, who seemed to belong more to the other world than to this, and heard the cause of her grief, the old woman said to her, "Cheer up, my daughter; do not despair; there is a remedy for every evil save death.
30: Now listen: if your father speaks to you thus once again, put this bit of wood into your mouth, and instantly you will be changed into a she-bear; then off with you!
31: for in his fright he will let you depart; and go straight to the wood, where Heaven has kept good-fortune in store for you since the day you were born: and whenever you wish to appear a woman, as you are and will remain, only take the piece of wood out of your mouth, and you will return to your true form."
32: Then Preziosa embraced the old woman, and giving her a good apronful of meal, and ham and bacon, sent her away.
35: Then the king asked his courtiers whether he could not marry Preziosa, as she was the picture of his dead wife.
36: But the instant Preziosa heard this, she slipped the bit of wood into her mouth, and took the figure of a terrible she-bear; at the sight of which all present were frightened out of their wits, and ran off as fast as they could scamper.
38: And there she staid, in the pleasant companionship of the other animals, until the son of the king of Running-Water came to hunt in that part of the country, who at the sight of the bear had like to have died on the spot.
39: But when he saw the beast come gently up to him, wagging her tail like a little dog and rubbing her sides against him, he took courage, and patted her, and said, "Good bear, good bear!
42: Then he led her home, and ordered that she should be taken good care of; and he had her put into a garden close to the royal palace, that he might see her from the window whenever he wished.
44: At the sight of this beauty, which was beyond the beyonds, he had like to have lost his senses with amazement, and tumbling down the stairs he ran out into the garden.
45: But Preziosa, who was on the watch and observed him, popped the piece of wood into her mouth, and was instantly changed into a bear again.
46: When the prince came down and looked about in vain for Preziosa, whom he had seen from the window above, he was so amazed at the trick that a deep melancholy came over him, and in four days he fell sick, crying continually, "My bear, my bear!"
47: His mother, hearing him wailing thus, imagined that the bear had done him some hurt, and gave orders that she should be killed.
49: When this came to the ears of the prince, he acted in a way to pass belief; ill or well he jumped out of bed, and was going at once to make mincemeat of the servants.
50: But when they told him the truth of the affair, he jumped on horseback, half-dead as he was, and went rambling about and seeking everywhere, until at length he found the bear.
51: Then he took her home again, and putting her into a chamber said to her, "O lovely morsel for a king who art shut up in this skin!
54: do you wish to see me pine and pant, and die by inches?
55: I am wasting away, without hope, and tormented by thy beauty; and you see clearly the proof, for I am shrunk two-thirds in size, like wine boiled down, and am nothing but skin and bone, for the fever is double-stitched to my veins.
56: So lift up the curtain of this hairy hide, and let me gaze upon the spectacle of thy beauty!
62: But when he had said and had said, this and a great deal more, and still saw that all his words were thrown away, he took to his bed again, and had such a   fit that the doctors prognosticated badly of his case.
63: Then his mother, who had no other joy in the world, sat down by his bedside, and said to him, "My son, whence comes all this grief?
67: If you want a wife, only choose, and I will bring the match about; do you take, and I'll pay.
71: When the prince heard these words, he said, "Nothing can console me but the sight of the bear; therefore, if you wish to see me well again, let her be brought into this chamber: I will have no one else to attend me, and make my bed, and cook for me, but she herself; and you may be sure that this pleasure will make me well in a trice."
73: And when the bear came up to the prince's bed, she raised her paw, and felt the patient's pulse; which made the queen laugh outright, for she thought every moment that the bear would scratch his nose.
74: Then the prince said, "My dear bear, will you not cook for me, and give me my food, and wait upon me?" and the bear nodded her head, to show that she accepted the office.
76: And when he had done eating, the bear handed him drink with such grace, that the queen was ready to kiss her on her forehead.
77: Thereupon the prince arose, and the bear quickly set about making the bed; and running into the garden, she gathered a clothful of roses and citron-flowers, and strewed them over it, so that the queen said the bear was worth her weight in gold, and that her son had good reason to be so fond of her.
81: Then the bear went up to the prince, and taking him by the cheeksPigliatala a pezzechille.
87: Then the queen inquired who the beautiful maiden was, and what had brought her to this savage life; and Preziosa related the whole story of her misfortunes, at which the queen, praising her as a good and virtuous girl, told her son that she was content that Preziosa should be his wife.
