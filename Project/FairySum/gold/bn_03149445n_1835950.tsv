0: On a verdant slope of Mount Maenalus, in Arcadia, there stands an olive grove about the ruins of a villa.
1: Close by is a tomb, once beautiful with the sublimest sculptures, but now fallen into as great decay as the house.
4: Many years ago, when the hillside villa was new and resplendent, there dwelt within it the two sculptors Kalos and Musides.
5: From Lydia to Neapolis the beauty of their work was praised, and none dared say that the one excelled the other in skill.
8: But though Kalos and Musides dwelt in unbroken harmony, their natures were not alike.
9: Whilst Musides revelled by night amidst the urban gaieties of Tegea, Kalos would remain at home; stealing away from the sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove.
12: So famous were Kalos and Musides, that none wondered when the Tyrant of Syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of Tyche which he had planned for his city.
14: Exalted beyond thought would be he whose work should gain acceptance, and for this honor Kalos and Musides were invited to compete.
15: Their brotherly love was well known, and the crafty Tyrant surmised that each, instead of concealing his work from the other, would offer aid and advice; this charity producing two images of unheard of beauty, the lovelier of which would eclipse even the dreams of poets.
20: But as time passed, men observed a want of gaiety in the once sparkling Musides.
22: Many months passed yet in the sour face of Musides came nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arouse.
23: Then one day Musides spoke of the illness of Kalos, after which none marvelled again at his sadness, since the sculptors' attachment was known to be deep and sacred.
26: As Kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend, he desired to be carried often to the grove which he so loved.
29: At last the end drew near, and Kalos discoursed of things beyond this life.
30: Musides, weeping, promised him a sepulchre more lovely than the tomb of Mausolus; but Kalos bade him speak no more of marble glories.
31: Only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man; that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his resting place-close to his head.
32: And one night, sitting alone in the darkness of the olive grove, Kalos died.
37: All honour was now his, since the Tyrant of Syracuse would have the work of none save him or Kalos.
38: His task proved a vent for his emotion and he toiled more steadily each day, shunning the gaieties he once had relished.
39: Meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend, where a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleeper's head.
42: Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to the Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty statue was finished.
43: By this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions, exceeding all other trees of its kind, and sending out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which Musides labored.
47: The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant's emissaries came to Tegea.
49: As the night wore on a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of Maenalus, and the men from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town.
56: Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peri-style had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins.
59: Amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt, and the representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans that they had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown.
60: However, the Syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in Athens, and the Tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple commemorating the gifts, virtues, and brotherly piety of Musides.
