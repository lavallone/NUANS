28: "I never thought I'd run another nuclear-bomb test, as long as I lived."  "Lee!"
34: We made lots of experiments like this, back before 1969."
35: The memories of all those other tests, each ending in an Everest-high mushroom column, rose in his mind.
36: And the end result--the United States and the Soviet Union blasted to rubble, a whole hemisphere pushed back into the Dark Ages, a quarter of a billion dead.
43: In all the years they'd worked together at the _Instituto Argentino de Ciencia Fisica_, that had been unmentioned between them.
69: "Auburn was hit an hour before the first American missile was launched.
78: "But who launched it, then?
79: It had to be launched by somebody."
91: That rocket wouldn't have had to have been launched anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere.
109: He'd questioned, at times, indignantly, of course, whether Russia had launched it--but it wasn't until tonight, until he had heard what Pitov had had to say, that he seriously doubted it.
110: Pitov wouldn't lie about it, and Pitov would have been in a position to have known the truth, if the missile had been launched from Russia.
144: There is still much hostility, arising from fear that we are testing a nuclear weapon."
169: We might have rocketed it into escape velocity and let it blow up in space, away from the Moon or any of the artificial satellites, but why waste it?
170: So we're going to have the rocket eject it, and when it falls, we can see, by our telemetered instruments, just what happens."
185: Before they went inside, Richardson glanced up at the sky, fixing the location of a few of the more conspicuous stars in his mind.
186: There were almost a hundred men and women inside, each at his or her instruments--view-screens, radar indicators, detection instruments of a dozen kinds.
190: They sat down side by side and waited.
196: Red and yellow flames were gushing out at the bottom of the rocket, and it was beginning to tremble.
197: Then the upper jets, the ones that furnished power for the generators, began firing.
205: In a moment, now, the rocket, a hundred miles overhead, would be nosing down, and then the warhead would open and the magnetic field inside would alter and the mass of negamatter would be ejected.
212: For a moment, Richardson wondered what was going on, and then shocked recognition drove that from his mind as he stared at the ever-brightening glare in the sky.
213: It was the Auburn Bomb again!
214: He was back, in memory, to the night on the shore of Lake Ontario; the party breaking up in the early hours of morning; he and Janet and the people with whom they had been spending a vacation week standing on the lawn as the guests were getting into their cars.
258: It had been two hours after the blast that the first drones had gone over what had been Auburn, New York.
275: "It was exactly like Auburn; even that blazing light that came rushing down out of the sky.
276: I wondered about that at the time--what kind of a missile would produce an effect like that.
277: Now I know.
278: We just launched one like it."
282: "Nobody, and nothing, on this planet built that mass of negamatter.
