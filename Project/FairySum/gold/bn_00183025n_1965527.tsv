3: "A dog-fight!" shouted Bob, and was off; and so was I, both of us all but praying that it might not be over before we got up!
7: Dogs like fighting; old Isaac says they "delight" in it, and for the best of all reasons; and boys are not cruel because they like to see the fight.
13: The crowd round a couple of dogs fighting is a crowd masculine mainly, with an occasional active, compassionate woman fluttering wildly round the outside and using her tongue and her hands freely upon the men, as so many "brutes;" it is a crowd annular, compact, and mobile; a crowd centripetal, having its eyes and its heads all bent downwards and inwards, to one common focus.
14: Well, Bob and I are up, and find it is not over: a small thoroughbred white bull terrier is busy throttling a large shepherd's dog, unaccustomed to war, but not to be trifled with.
15: They are hard at it; the scientific little fellow doing his work in great style, his pastoral enemy fighting wildly, but with the sharpest of teeth and a great courage.
16: Science and breeding, however, soon had their own; the Game Chicken, as the premature Bob called him, working his way up, took his final grip of poor Yarrow's throat,--and he lay gasping and done for.
17: His master, a brown, handsome, big young shepherd from Tweedsmuir, would have liked to have knocked down any man, would "drink up Esil, or eat a crocodile," for that part, if he had a chance: it was no use kicking the little dog; that would only make him hold the closer.
60: Six years have passed,--a long time for a boy and a dog: Bob Ainslie is off to the wars; I am a medical student, and clerk at Minto House Hospital.
61: Rab I saw almost every week, on the Wednesday; and we had much pleasant intimacy.
63: When I did not notice him he would plant himself straight before me, and stand wagging that bud of a tail, and looking up, with his head a little to the one side.
64: His master I occasionally saw; he used to call me "Maister John," but was laconic as any Spartan.
65: One fine October afternoon, I was leaving the hospital, when I saw the large gate open, and in walked Rab, with that great and easy saunter of his.
66: He looked as if taking general possession of the place; like the Duke of Wellington entering a subdued city, satiated with victory and peace.
67: After him came Jess, now white from age, with her cart, and in it a woman carefully wrapped up,--the carrier leading the horse anxiously, and looking back.
68: When he saw me, James (for his name was James Noble) made a curt and grotesque "boo," and said, "Maister John, this is the mistress; she's got a trouble in her breest,--some kind o' an income, we're thinkin'."
73: "Ailie," said James, "this is Maister John, the young doctor; Rab's freend, ye ken.
75: She smiled, and made a movement, but said nothing, and prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising.
78: Rab looked on concerned and puzzled, but ready for anything that might turn up,--were it to strangle the nurse, the porter, or even me.
79: Ailie and he seemed great friends.
80: "As I was sayin', she's got a kind o' trouble in her breest, doctor: wull ye tak' a look at it?"
82: Ailie sat down, undid her open gown and her lawn handkerchief round her neck, and, without a word, showed me her right breast.
85: There it was, that had once been so soft, so shapely, so white, so gracious and bountiful, so "full of all blessed conditions,"--hard as a stone, a centre of horrid pain, making that pale face, with its gray, lucid, reasonable eyes, and its sweet resolved mouth, express the full measure of suffering overcome.
1: Next day, my master, the surgeon, examined Ailie.
102: There was no doubt it must kill her, and soon.
103: It could be removed; it might never return; it would give her speedy relief: she should have it done.
104: She courtesied, looked at James, and said, "When?"
105: "To-morrow," said the kind surgeon,--a man of few words.
106: She and James and Rab and I retired.
108: The following day, at noon, the students came in, hurrying up the great stair.
114: The operating theatre is crowded; much talk and fun, and all the cordiality and stir of youth.
115: The surgeon with his staff of assistants is there.
124: The operation was at once begun; it was necessarily slow; and chloroform--one of God's best gifts to his suffering children--was then unknown.
129: It is over: she is dressed, steps gently and decently down from the table, looks for James; then, turning to the surgeon and the students, she courtesies, and in a low, clear voice begs their pardon if she has behaved ill.
140: For some days Ailie did well.
144: The surgeon dressed her, and spoke to her in his own short kind way, pitying her through his eyes, Rab and James outside the circle,--Rab being now reconciled, and even cordial, and having made up his mind that as yet nobody required worrying, but, as you may suppose, semper paratus.
145: So far well; but four days after the operation my patient had a sudden and long shivering, a "groosin'," as she called it.
146: I saw her soon after; her eyes were too bright, her cheek colored; she was restless, and ashamed of being so; the balance was lost; mischief had begun.
148: We tried what we could.
150: Ailie got worse; began to wander in her mind, gently; was more demonstrative in her ways to James, rapid in her questions, and sharp at times.
163: She was walking, alone, through the valley of that shadow into which one day we must all enter; and yet she was not alone, for we know whose rod and staff were comforting her.
164: One night she had fallen quiet, and, as we hoped, asleep; her eyes were shut.
165: We put down the gas, and sat watching her.
166: Suddenly she sat up in bed, and, taking a bed-gown which was lying on it rolled up, she held it eagerly to her breast,--to the right side.
172: And then she rocked backward and forward, as if to make it sleep, hushing it, and wasting on it her infinite fondness.
180: She sank rapidly: the delirium left her; but, as she whispered, she was "clean silly;" it was the lightening before the final darkness.
181: After having for some time lain still, her eyes shut, she said, "James!"
188: James and I sat, I don't know how long, but for some time, saying nothing: he started up abruptly, and with some noise went to the table, and, putting his right fore and middle fingers each into a shoe, pulled them out, and put them on, breaking one of the leather latchets, and muttering in anger, "I never did the like o' that afore!"
197: It was November, and there had been a heavy fall of snow.
200: I did not see James; he was already at the door, and came up the stairs and met me.
201: It was less than three hours since he left, and he must have posted out--who knows how?--to Howgate, full nine miles off, yoked Jess, and driven her astonished into town.
202: He had an armful of blankets, and was streaming with perspiration.
213: James buried his wife, with his neighbors mourning, Rab watching the proceedings from a distance.
214: It was snow, and that black ragged hole would look strange in the midst of the swelling spotless cushion of white.
215: James looked after everything; then rather suddenly fell ill, and took to bed; was insensible when the doctor came, and soon died.
218: A fresh fall of snow had again made all things white and smooth; Rab once more looked on, and slunk home to the stable.
219: And what of Rab?
220: I asked for him next week at the new carrier who got the good-will of James's business and was now master of Jess and her cart. 224: "Where's Rab?"
225: He, getting confused and red, and intermeddling with his hair, said, '"Deed, sir, Rab's deid."
236: He was buried in the braeface, near the burn, the children of the village, his companions, who used to make very free with him and sit on his ample stomach as he lay half asleep at the door in the sun, watching the solemnity.
