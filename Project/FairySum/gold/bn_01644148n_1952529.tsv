10: Now that he's disappeared I go round to the club once in a while, but my nerves aren't what they were.
13: Let the police find what they can—it won't be much, judging from the fact that they don't know yet of the old North End place he hired under the name of Peters.
22: Boston never had a greater painter than Richard Upton Pickman.
26: Any magazine-cover hack can splash paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or a Witches' Sabbath or a portrait of the devil, but only a great painter can make such a thing really scare or ring true.
57: I got into the habit of calling on Pickman quite often, especially after I began making notes for a monograph on weird art.
59: He showed me all the paintings and drawings he had about; including some pen-and-ink sketches that would, I verily believe, have got him kicked out of the club if many of the members had seen them.
61: My hero-worship, coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him, made him get very confidential with me; and one evening he hinted that if I were fairly close-mouthed and none too squeamish, he might show me something rather unusual—something a bit stronger than anything he had in the house.
62: 'You know,' he said, 'there are things that won't do for Newbury Street—things that are out of place here, and that can't be conceived here, anyhow.
79: Look here, do you know the whole North End once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with each other's houses, and the burying ground, and the sea?
87: What do maps and records and guide-books really tell of the North End?
89: At a guess I'll guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of Prince Street that aren't suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them.
94: What if I told you that I've got another studio up there, where I can catch the night-spirit of antique horror and paint things that I couldn't even think of in Newbury Street?
99: I took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellar—one of the sort I told you about.
100: The shack's almost tumbling down so that nobody else would live there, and I'd hate to tell you how little I pay for it.
102: I paint in the cellar, where the inspiration is thickest, but I've other rooms furnished on the ground floor.
104: 'Now, if you're game, I'll take you there tonight.
117: Now, Eliot, I'm what the man in the street would call fairly 'hard-boiled,' but I'll confess that what I saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn.
118: They were his pictures, you know—the ones he couldn't paint or even show in Newbury Street—and he was right when he said he had 'let himself go.'
120: There's no use in my trying to tell you what they were like, because the awful, the blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify.
125: These figures were seldom completely human, but often approached humanity in varying degree.
136: But don't get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting which struck me faint.
138: It was the faces, Eliot, those accursed faces, that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of life!
139: By God, man, I verily believe they were alive!
140: That nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment, and his brush had been a nightmare-spawning wand.
153: By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to see his 'modern studies.'
157: Remember, too, that I'd just about recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial New England into a kind of annex of hell.
158: Well, in spite of all this, that next room forced a real scream out of me, and I had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over.
164: One disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast cross-section of Beacon Hill, with ant-like armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground.
165: Dances in the modern cemeteries were freely pictured, and another conception somehow shocked me more than all the rest—a scene in an unknown vault, where scores of the beasts crowded about one who had a well-known Boston guidebook and was evidently reading aloud.
166: All were pointing to a certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that I almost thought I heard the fiendish echoes.
181: My host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio, and I braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases.
182: As we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he fumed his flash-light to a corner of the large open space at hand, revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor.
186: Thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if Pickman's wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size, provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio.
193: There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half-finished monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream—the second I had emitted that night.
196: Eliot, but I don't know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy.
198: It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy.
200: But damn it all, it wasn't even the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountain-head of all panic—not that, nor the dog face with its pointed ears, bloodshot eyes, flat nose, and drooling lips.
204: The monster was there—it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared—and I knew that only a suspension of Nature's laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a model—without some glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the Fiend has ever had.
205: Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled up—probably, I thought, a photograph from which Pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance.
206: I reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly I saw Pickman start as if shot.
207: He had been listening with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar, and now he seemed struck with a fright which, though not comparable to my own, had in it more of the physical than of the spiritual.
208: He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence, then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him.
211: , I fancied I heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere, and a series of squeals or beats in a direction I couldn't determine.
213: Then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh—a furtive, groping kind of clatter, though I can't attempt to convey what I mean in words.
216: There was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther than it had fallen before.
217: After that followed a sharp grating noise, a shouted gibberish from Pickman, and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver, fired spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect.
219: Then more wood and brick grating, a pause, and the opening of the door—at which I'll confess I started violently.
220: Pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon, cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient well.
221: 'The deuce knows what they eat, Thurber,' he grinned, 'for those archaic tunnels touched graveyard and witch-den and sea-coast.
224: Better be cautious in these old places—our rodent friends are the one drawback, though I sometimes think they're a positive asset by way of atmosphere and colour.'
225: Well, Eliot, that was the end of the night's adventure.
236: We've had enough of the other stuff, but I for one need something.
237: No—it wasn't the paintings I saw in that place; though I'll swear they were enough to get him ostracised in nine-tenths of the homes and clubs of Boston, and I guess you won't wonder now why I have to steer clear of subways and cellars.
238: It was—something I found in my coat the next morning.
239: You know, the curled-up paper tacked to the frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster.
240: That last scare had come while I was reaching to uncurl it, and it seems I had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket.
242: Yes, that paper was the reason I dropped Pickman; Richard Upton Pickman, the greatest artist I have ever known—and the foulest being that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness.
252: Well—that paper wasn't a photograph of any background, after all.
253: What it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas.
254: It was the model he was using—and its background was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail.
255: But by God, Eliot, it was a photograph from life!
