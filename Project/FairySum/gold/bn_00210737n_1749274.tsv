0: ALYOSHA was the younger brother.
1: He was called the Pot, because his mother had once sent him with a pot of milk to the deacon's wife, and he had stumbled against something and broken it.
7: Alyosha went to the village school, but was not good at lessons; besides, there was so little time to learn.
8: His elder brother was in town, working for a merchant, so Alyosha had to help his father from a very early age.
15: Alyosha was nineteen when his brother was taken as a soldier.
16: So his father placed him with the merchant as a yard-porter.
33: They sent him on all sorts of errands, but he did everything quickly and readily, going from one task to another without stopping.
59: At holiday times there was more work than ever, but Alyosha liked holidays because everybody gave him a tip.
60: Not much certainly,
61: but it would amount up to about sixty kopeks [1s 2d]—his very own money.
62: For Alyosha never set eyes on his wages.
63: His father used to come and take them from the merchant, and only scold Alyosha for wearing out his boots.
65: Alyosha was not talkative; when he spoke at all, he spoke abruptly, with his head turned away.
67: Alyosha did not know any prayer; and had forgotten what his mother had taught him.
68: But he prayed just the same, every morning and every evening, prayed with his hands, crossing himself.
69: He lived like this for about a year and a half, and towards the end of the second year a most startling thing happened to him.
70: He discovered one day, to his great surprise, that, in addition to the relation of usefulness existing between people, there was also another, a peculiar relation of quite a different character.
73: He made this discovery through the cook Ustinia.
75: He felt for the first time in his life that he—not his services, but he himself—was necessary to another human being.
84: He would often think of her while at work, or when running on errands.
85: "A fine girl, Ustinia!"
86: he sometimes exclaimed.
91: On one occasion she asked him if his parents intended marrying him soon.
93: "Have you taken a fancy to some one, then?"
94: "I would marry you, if you'd be willing."
98: At Shrovetide Alyosha's father came to town for his wages.
114: He went into the kitchen, and sat down at the table waiting for his son.
115: Alyosha was out on an errand, and came back breathless.
121: They tell me you want to get married.
122: You shall get married when the time comes.
125: When his father had quite finished, Alyosha smiled.
126: "All right.
129: When he was left alone with Ustinia he told her what his father had said.
138: "Well, are you going to give up that nonsense, as your father told you?"
139: his mistress asked, as he was putting up the shutters in the evening.
140: "To be sure we are," Alyosha replied with a smile, and then burst into tears.
141: From that day Alyosha went about his work as usual, and no longer talked to Ustinia about their getting married.
142: One day in Lent the clerk told him to clear the snow from the roof.
143: Alyosha climbed on to the roof and swept away all the snow; and, while he was still raking out some frozen lumps from the gutter, his foot slipped and he fell over.
155: Alyosha lay in bed for two days, and on the third day they sent for the priest.
156: "Are you really going to die?"
157: Ustinia asked.
158: "Of course I am.
170: He lay in wonderment, then stretched himself, and died.
