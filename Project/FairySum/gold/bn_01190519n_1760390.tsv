0: Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress.
1: He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes.
4: One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance.
5: They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to every one who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.
6: “These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!”
7: thought the Emperor.
10: And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly.
11: So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all.
13: “I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,” said the Em- peror to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture.
14: “To be sure,” he thought, “he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair.
17: So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might, at their empty looms.
21: The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames.
22: The poor old minister looked and looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there.
27: I will never confess that I could not see the stuff.”
28: “Well, Sir Minister!” said one of the knaves, still pretending to work, “you do not say whether the stuff pleases you.
29: “Oh, it is excellent!”
30: replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles.
31: “This pattern, and the colors—yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.”
35: The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready.
36: It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.
37: “Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?” asked the impostors of the Emperor’s second ambassador; at the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design and colors which were not there.
41: And accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns.
42: “Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,” said he to his sovereign when he returned, “the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent.”
44: And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom.
45: Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of the Emperor’s approach, went on working more diligently than ever; although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.
57: All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, “Oh how beautiful!” and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching procession.
63: The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor’s new suit.
64: They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them.
65: “See!” cried they, at last, “the Emperor’s new clothes are ready!”
66: And now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the weavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding something up, saying, “Here are your Majesty’s trowsers!
71: “If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.”
72: The Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side, before the looking glass.
83: So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, “Oh! how beautiful are our Emperor’s new clothes!
85: in short, no one would allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office.
87: “But the Emperor has nothing at all on!” said a little child.
88: “Listen to the voice of innocence!”
89: exclaimed his father; and what the child had said was whispered from one to another.
92: The Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he thought the procession must go on now!
