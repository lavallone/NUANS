0: A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below.
2: A rope closely encircled his neck.
4: Some loose boards laid upon the ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners—two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff.
20: The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age.
21: He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter.
41: Striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith’s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.
48: What he heard was the ticking of his watch.
50: “If I could free my hands,” he thought, “I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream.
55: Peyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family.
56: Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause.
61: One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water.
64: “The Yanks are repairing the railroads,” said the man, “and are getting ready for another advance.
75: “I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge.
76: It is now dry and would burn like tinder.”
77: The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank.
78: He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.
79: An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come.
80: He was a Federal scout.
81: As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead.
91: Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.
92: The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream.
123: He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.
140: Farquhar dived—dived as deeply as he could.
144: As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream—nearer to safety.
164: In few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream—the southern bank—and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies.
174: All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun.
193: Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene—perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium.
194: He stands at the gate of his own home.
197: As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him.
201: As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon—then all is darkness and silence!
202: Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.
