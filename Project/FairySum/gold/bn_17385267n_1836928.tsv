0: ONE summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his board near the window, and working cheerfully with all his might, when an old woman came down the street crying, "Good jelly to sell!
2: The cry sounded pleasant in the little tailor's ears, so he put his head out of the window, and called out, "Here, my good woman come here, if you want a customer."
6: "This jelly is the very thing for me," cried the little tailor; "it will give me strength and cunning;" and he took down the bread from the cupboard, cut a whole round of the loaf, and spread the jelly on it, laid it near him, and went on stitching more gallantly than ever.
7: All the while the scent of the sweet jelly was spreading throughout the room, where there were quantities of flies, who were attracted by it and flew to partake.
10: Then the tailor, not being able to stand it any longer, took from his chimney-corner a ragged cloth, and saying, "Now, I'll let you have it!" beat it among them unmercifully.
11: When he ceased, and counted the slain, he found seven lying dead before him.
13: So he hastened to cut out a belt, and he stitched it, and put on it in large capitals "Seven at one blow!"
14: "——The town, did I say!" said the little tailor; "the whole world shall know it!"
16: The tailor fastened the belt round him, and began to think of going out into the world, for his workshop seemed too small for his worship.
18: Outside the door he noticed that a bird had got caught in the bushes, so he took that and put it in his pocket with the cheese.
20: The way led over a mountain, and when he reached the topmost peak he saw a terrible giant sitting there, and looking about him at his ease.
21: The tailor went bravely up to him, called out to him, and said, "Comrade, good day!
27: The giant read: "Seven at one blow!"
28: and thinking it meant men that the tailor had killed, felt at once more respect for the little fellow.
29: But as he wanted to prove him, he took up a stone and squeezed it so hard that water came out of it.
31: "That's not much," said the little tailor, "I call that play," and he put his hand in his pocket and took out the cheese and squeezed it, so that the whey ran out of it.
34: Then the giant took up a stone and threw it so high that it was nearly out of sight.
36: "Well thrown," said the tailor; "but the stone fell back to earth again,—I will throw you one that will never come back."
37: So he felt in his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.
38: And the bird, when it found itself at liberty, took wing, flew off, and returned no more.
40: "There is no doubt that you can throw," said the giant; "but we will see if you can carry."
41: He led the little tailor to a mighty oak-tree which had been felled, and was lying on the ground, and said, "Now, if you are strong enough, help me to carry this tree out of the wood."
42: "Willingly," answered the little man: "you take the trunk on your shoulders, I will take the branches with all their foliage, that is much the most difficult."
43: So the giant took the trunk on his shoulders, and the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not see what he was doing, had the whole tree to carry, and the little man on it as well.
45: The giant, when he had struggled on under his heavy load a part of the way, was tired out, and cried, "Look here, I must let go the tree!"
46: The tailor jumped off quickly, and taking hold of the tree with both arms, as if he were carrying it, said to the giant, "You see you can't carry the tree though you are such a big fellow!"
55: Then said the giant, "As you are such a gallant fellow, suppose you come with me to our den, and stay the night."
59: And the giant showed him a bed, and told him he had better lie down upon it and go to sleep.
60: The bed was, however, too big for the tailor, so he did not stay in it, but crept into a corner to sleep.
61: As soon as it was midnight the giant got up, took a great staff of iron and beat the bed through with one stroke, and supposed he had made an end of that grasshopper of a tailor.
62: Very early in the morning the giants went into the wood and forgot all about the little tailor, and when they saw him coming after them alive and merry, they were terribly frightened, and, thinking he was going to kill them, they ran away in all haste.
63: So the little tailor marched on, always following his nose.
64: And after he had gone a great way he entered the courtyard belonging to a King's palace, and there he felt so overpowered with fatigue that he lay down and fell asleep.
65: In the meanwhile came various people, who looked at him very curiously, and read on his belt, "Seven at one blow!"
69: The King then summoned his council, and sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to beg him, so soon as he should wake up, to consent to serve in the King's army.
71: And the answer was, "That was the reason for which I came," said the little tailor, "I am ready to enter the King's service."
73: But the rest of the soldiers were very much set against the little tailor, and they wished him a thousand miles away.
77: So they came to a resolution, and went all together to the King to ask for their discharge.
79: The King felt sorry to lose all his faithful servants because of one man, and he wished that he had never seen him, and would willingly get rid of him if he might.
82: He sent for the little tailor, and told him that as he was so great a warrior he had a proposal to make to him.
83: He told him that in a wood in his dominions dwelt two giants, who did great damage by robbery, murder, and fire, and that no man durst go near them for fear of his life.
84: But that if the tailor should overcome and slay both these giants the King would give him his only daughter in marriage, and half his kingdom as dowry, and that a hundred horsemen should go with him to give him assistance.
85: "That would be something for a man like me!"
86: thought the little tailor, "a beautiful princess and half a kingdom are not to be had every day," and he said to the King, "Oh yes, I can soon overcome the giants, and yet have no need of the hundred horsemen; he who can kill seven at one blow has no need to be afraid of two."
90: After a while he caught sight of the two giants; they were lying down under a tree asleep, and snoring so that all the branches shook.
91: The little tailor, all alive, filled both his pockets with stones and climbed up into the tree, and made his way to an overhanging bough, so that he could seat himself just above the sleepers; and from there he let one stone after another fall on the chest of one of the giants.
98: Then the little tailor began his game anew, picked out a heavier stone and threw it down with force upon the first giant's chest.
99: "This is too much!" cried he, and sprang up like a madman and struck his companion such a blow that the tree shook above them.
100: The other paid him back with ready coin, and they fought with such fury that they tore up trees by their roots to use for weapons against each other, so that at last they both of them lay dead upon the ground.
107: The little tailor then claimed the promised boon, but the King repented him of his offer, and he sought again how to rid himself of the hero.
108: "Before you can possess my daughter and the half of my kingdom," said he to the tailor, "you must perform another heroic act.
109: In the wood lives a unicorn who does great damage; you must secure him."
110: "A unicorn does not strike more terror into me than two giants.
111: Seven at one blow!—that is my way," was the tailor's answer.
112: So, taking a rope and an axe with him, he went out into the wood, and told those who were ordered to attend him to wait outside.
114: "Softly, softly," said he, "most haste, worst speed," and remained standing until the animal came quite near, then he slipped quietly behind a tree.
115: The unicorn ran with all his might against the tree and stuck his horn so deep into the trunk that he could not get it out again, and so was taken.
117: The King did not yet wish to give him the promised reward, and set him a third task to do.
118: Before the wedding could take place the tailor was to secure a wild boar which had done a great deal of damage in the wood.
119: The huntsmen were to accompany him.
122: When the boar caught sight of the tailor he ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming tusks to bear him to the ground, but the nimble hero rushed into a chapel which chanced to be near, and jumped quickly out of a window on the other side.
123: The boar ran after him, and when he got inside the door shut after him, and there he was imprisoned, for the creature was too big and unwieldy to jump out of the window too.
124: Then the little tailor called the huntsmen that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes; and then he betook himself to the king, who now, whether he liked it or not, was obliged to fulfil his promise, and give him his daughter and the half of his kingdom.
127: One night the young queen heard her husband talking in his sleep and saying, "Now boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders!"
128: And so, as she perceived of what low birth her husband was, she went to her father the next morning and told him all, and begged him to set her free from a man who was nothing better than a tailor.
129: The king bade her be comforted, saying, "To-night leave your bedroom door open, my guard shall stand outside, and when he is asleep they shall come in and bind him and carry him off to a ship, and he shall be sent to the other side of the world."
130: So the wife felt consoled, but the king's water-bearer, who had been listening all the while, went to the little tailor and disclosed to him the whole plan "I shall put a stop to all this," said he.
131: At night he lay down as usual in bed, and when his wife thought that he was asleep, she got up, opened the door and lay down again.
132: The little tailor, who only made believe to be asleep, began to murmur plainly, "Now, boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders!
133: I have slain seven at one blow, killed two giants, caught a unicorn, and taken a wild boar, and shall I be afraid of those who are standing outside my room door?"
134: And when they heard the tailor say this, a great fear seized them; they fled away as if they had been wild hares, and none of them would venture to attack him.
135: And so the little tailor all his lifetime remained a king.
