0: There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I will tell of the Street.
2: At first it was but a path trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach.
3: Then, as more men came to the growing cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell, they built cabins along the north side, cabins of stout oaken logs with masonry on the side toward the forest, for many Indians lurked there with fire-arrows.
10: There was war, and thereafter no more Indians troubled the Street.
11: The men, busy with labour, waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to be.
14: The town was now a city, and one by one the cabins gave place to houses—simple, beautiful houses of brick and wood, with stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors.
25: Once, most of the young men went away, and some never came back.
26: That was when they furled the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars.
36: Then came days of evil, when many who had known the Street of old knew it no more, and many knew it who had not known it before, and went away, for their accents were coarse and strident, and their mien and faces unpleasing.
37: Their thoughts, too, fought with the wise, just spirit of the Street, so that the Street pined silently as its houses fell into decay, and its trees died one by one, and its rose-gardens grew rank with weeds and waste.
40: With the years, worse fortune came to the Street.
41: Its trees were all gone now, and its rose-gardens were displaced by the backs of cheap, ugly new buildings on parallel streets.
43: New kinds of faces appeared in the Street, swarthy, sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features, whose owners spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and unknown characters upon most of the musty houses.
67: The rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of a vast band of terrorists, who on a designated day were to launch an orgy of slaughter for the extermination of America and of all the fine old traditions which the Street had loved.
68: Handbills and papers fluttered about filthy gutters; handbills and papers printed in many tongues and in many characters, yet all bearing messages of crime and rebellion.
71: All this was said and repeated, and many looked forward in dread to the fourth day of July, about which the strange writings hinted much; yet could nothing be found to place the guilt.
76: So the Street slept uneasily on, till one night there gathered in Petrovitch’s Bakery, and the Rifkin School of Modern Economics, and the Circle Social Club, and Liberty Cafe, and in other places as well, vast hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and expectation.
81: It was, indeed, an exceedingly singular happening, though after all, a simple one.
82: For without warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after the crash there was nothing left standing in the Street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall.
84: A poet and a traveler, who came with the mighty crowd that sought the scene, tell odd stories.
85: The poet says that all through the hours before dawn he beheld sordid ruins indistinctly in the glare of the arc-lights; that there loomed above the wreckage another picture wherein he could describe moonlight and fair houses and elms and oaks and maples of dignity.
86: And the traveler declares that instead of the place’s wonted stench there lingered a delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom.
