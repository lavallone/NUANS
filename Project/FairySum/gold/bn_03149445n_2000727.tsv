0: On a verdant slope of Mount Maenalus, in Arcadia, there stands an olive grove about the ruins of a villa.
1: Close by is a tomb, once beautiful with the sublimest sculptures, but now fallen into as great decay as the house.
2: At one end of that tomb, its curious roots displacing the time-stained blocks of Pentelic marble, grows an unnaturally large olive tree of oddly repellent shape; so like to some grotesque man, or death-distorted body of a man, that the country folk fear to pass it at night when the moon shines faintly through the crooked boughs.
4: Many years ago, when the hillside villa was new and resplendent, there dwelt within it the two sculptors Kalos and Musides.
8: But though Kalos and Musides dwelt in unbroken harmony, their natures were not alike.
9: Whilst Musides revelled by night amidst the urban gaieties of Tegea, Kalos would remain at home; stealing away from the sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove.
12: So famous were Kalos and Musides, that none wondered when the Tyrant of Syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of Tyche which he had planned for his city.
13: Of great size and cunning workmanship must the statue be, for it was to form a wonder of nations and a goal of travellers.
14: Exalted beyond thought would be he whose work should gain acceptance, and for this honor Kalos and Musides were invited to compete.
22: Many months passed yet in the sour face of Musides came nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arouse.
23: Then one day Musides spoke of the illness of Kalos, after which none marvelled again at his sadness, since the sculptors' attachment was known to be deep and sacred.
24: Subsequently many went to visit Kalos, and indeed noticed the pallor of his face; but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of Musides who was clearly distracted with anxiety and who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own hands.
26: As Kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend, he desired to be carried often to the grove which he so loved.
28: Musides ever granted his requests, though his eyes filled with visible tears at the thought that Kalos should care more for the fauns and the dryads than for him.
31: Only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man; that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his resting place-close to his head.
32: And one night, sitting alone in the darkness of the olive grove, Kalos died.
33: Beautiful beyond words was the marble sepulchre which stricken Musides carved for his beloved friend.
36: As the first violence of Musides' grief gave place to resignation, he labored with diligence upon his figure of Tyche.
39: Meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend, where a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleeper's head.
40: So swift was the growth of this tree, and so strange was its form,
41: that all who beheld it exclaimed in surprise; and Musides seemed at once fascinated and repelled.
42: Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to the Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty statue was finished.
44: As many visitors came to view the prodigious tree, as to admire the art of the sculptor, so that Musides was seldom alone.
47: The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant's emissaries came to Tegea.
49: As the night wore on a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of Maenalus, and the men from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town.
54: In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant's messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done strange things.
56: Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peri-style had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins.
57: Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos.
58: And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment, for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of Tyche, no trace could be discovered.
60: However, the Syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in Athens, and the Tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple commemorating the gifts, virtues, and brotherly piety of Musides.
61: But the olive grove still stands, as does the tree growing out of the tomb of Kalos, and the old bee-keeper told me that sometimes the boughs whisper to one another in the night wind, saying over and over again.
