4: Mr. Offord, the most agreeable, the most lovable of bachelors, was a retired diplomatist, living on his pension, confined by his infirmities to his fireside and delighted to be found there any afternoon in the year by such visitors as Brooksmith allowed to come up.
5: Brooksmith was his butler and his most intimate friend, to whom we all stood, or I should say sat, in the same relation in which the subject of the sovereign finds himself to the prime minister.
6: By having been for years, in foreign lands, the most delightful Englishman any one had ever known, Mr. Offord had, in my opinion, rendered signal service to his country.
10: His circle, therefore, was essentially composed of habitués, who were habitués for each other as well as for him, as those of a happy salon should be.
13: Many persons have heard much, though most have doubtless seen little, of the famous institution of the salon, and many are born to the depression of knowing that this finest flower of social life refuses to bloom where the English tongue is spoken.
14: The explanation is usually that our women have not the skill to cultivate it—the art to direct, between suggestive shores, the course of the stream of talk.
26: Mr. Offord had solved the insoluble; he had, without feminine help (save in the sense that ladies were dying to come to him and he saved the lives of several), established a salon; but I might have guessed that there was a method in his madness—a law in his success.
28: There was an art in it all, and how was the art so hidden?
29: Who, indeed, if it came to that, was the occult artist?
32: How was it, for instance, that we never were a crowd, never either too many or too few, always the right people with the right people (there must really have been no wrong people at all), always coming and going, never sticking fast nor overstaying, yet never popping in or out with an indecorous familiarity?
33: How was it that we all sat where we wanted and moved when we wanted and met whom we wanted and escaped whom we wanted; joining, according to the accident of inclination, the general circle or falling in with a single talker on a convenient sofa?
36: These speculations couldn't fail to lead me to the fundamental truth that Brooksmith had been somehow at the bottom of the mystery.
37: If he had not established the salon at least he had carried it on.
38: Brooksmith, in short, was the artist!
39: We felt this, covertly, at the time, without formulating it, and were conscious, as an ordered and prosperous community, of his evenhanded justice, untainted with flunkeyism.
49: I remember the old man's saying to me: "Oh, my servants, if they can live with me a fortnight they can live with me for ever.
50: But it's the first fortnight that tries 'em."
51: It was in the first fortnight, for instance, that Brooksmith had had to learn that he was exposed to being addressed as "my dear fellow" and "my poor child."
54: "He thinks me rather mad, but I've broken him in, and now he likes the place, he likes the company," said the old man.
55: I embraced this fully after I had become aware that Brooksmith's main characteristic was a deep and shy refinement, though I remember I was rather puzzled when, on another occasion, Mr. Offord remarked: "What he likes is the talk—mingling in the conversation."
56: I was conscious that I had never seen Brooksmith permit himself this freedom, but I guessed in a moment that what Mr. Offord alluded to was a participation more intense than any speech could have represented—that of being perpetually present on a hundred legitimate pretexts, errands, necessities, and breathing the very atmosphere of criticism, the famous criticism of life.
61: There were certain things Mr. Offord was capable of pretending he liked you to do, even when he didn't, if he thought you liked them.
62: If it happened that you didn't either (this was rare, but it might be), of course there were cross-purposes; but Brooksmith was there to prevent their going very far.
63: This was precisely the way he acted as moderator: he averted misunderstandings or cleared them up.
70: I often noticed that if an anecdote or a quotation, much more a lively discussion, was going forward, he would, if busy with the fire or the curtains, the lamp or the tea, find a pretext for remaining in the room till the point should be reached.
76: The first day Mr. Offord's door was closed was therefore a dark date in contemporary history.
80: When I did understand that the old man had given up, for the first time, though only for the occasion, I exclaimed dolefully: "What a difference it will make—and to how many people!"
95: At last it came to be the case that we all found the closed door more often than the open one; but even when it was closed Brooksmith managed a crack for me to squeeze through; so that practically I never turned away without having paid a visit.
96: The difference simply came to be that the visit was to Brooksmith.
99: It is true that the subject of my meditation was ever the same—ever "It's all very well, but what will become of Brooksmith?"
100: Even my private answer to this question left me still unsatisfied.
101: No doubt Mr. Offord would provide for him, but what would he provide?
111: One of the most assiduous members of our circle had been Lady Kenyon, and I remember his telling me one day that her ladyship had, in spite of her own infirmities, lately much aggravated, been in person to inquire.
119: Several times he took me upstairs—always by his own proposal—and our dear old friend, in bed, in a curious flowered and brocaded casaque which made him, especially as his head was tied up in a handkerchief to match, look, to my imagination, like the dying Voltaire, held for ten minutes a sadly shrunken little salon.
120: I felt indeed each time, as if I were attending the last coucher of some social sovereign.
123: Now and again, I confess, there was one at Brooksmith's, but so pathetically sociable as to make the excellent man look at me in a way that seemed to say: "Do exchange a glance with me, or I sha'n't be able to stand it."
124: What he was not able to stand was not what Mr. Offord said about him, but what he wasn't able to say in return.
125: His notion of conversation, for himself, was giving you the convenience of speaking to him; and when he went to "see" Lady Kenyon, for instance, it was to carry her the tribute of his receptive silence.
126: Where would the speech of his betters have been if proper service had been a manifestation of sound?
127: In that case the fundamental difference would have had to be shown by their dumbness, and many of them, poor things, were dumb enough without that provision.
128: Brooksmith took an unfailing interest in the preservation of the fundamental difference; it was the thing he had most on his conscience.
129: What had become of it, however, when Mr. Offord passed away like any inferior person—was relegated to eternal stillness like a butler upstairs?
131: When everything was over—it was late the same day—I knocked at the door of the house of mourning as I so often had done before.
132: I could never call on Mr. Offord again, but I had come, literally, to call on Brooksmith.
134: My wild dream of taking him into my own service had died away: my service was not worth his being taken into.
135: My offer to him could only be to help him to find another place, and yet there was an indelicacy, as it were, in taking for granted that his thoughts would immediately be fixed on another.
142: Two definite facts, however, he had to communicate; one being that he was to leave the house for ever that night (servants, for some mysterious reason, seem always to depart by night), and the other—he mentioned it only at the last, with hesitation—that he had already been informed his late master had left him a legacy of eighty pounds.
144: This was all that passed between us on the subject, and I know nothing of his judgment of Mr. Offord's memento.
152: I interposed with a few words to the effect that I was well aware that wherever he should go, whatever he should do, he would miss our old friend terribly—miss him even more than I should, having been with him so much more.
166: He had given me his address—the place where he would be to be heard of.
167: For a long time I had no occasion to make use of the information; for he proved indeed, on trial, a very difficult case.
168: In a word the people who knew him and had known Mr. Offord, didn't want to take him, and yet I couldn't bear to try to thrust him among people who didn't know him.
169: I spoke to many of our old friends about him, and I found them all governed by the odd mixture of feelings of which I myself was conscious, and disposed, further, to entertain a suspicion that he was "spoiled," with which I then would have nothing to do.
170: In plain terms a certain embarrassment, a sensible awkwardness, when they thought of it, attached to the idea of using him as a menial: they had met him so often in society.
179: There was a certain amount, however, it seemed; for the following year, going one day to call on a country cousin, a lady of a certain age who was spending a fortnight in town with some friends of her own, a family unknown to me and resident in Chester Square, the door of the house was opened, to my surprise and gratification, by Brooksmith in person.
180: When I came out I had some conversation with him, from which I gathered that he had found the large City people too dull for endurance, and I guessed, though he didn't say it, that he had found them vulgar as well.
192: I thought he looked lean and wasted, and I guessed that his new place was not more "human" than his previous one.
196: The next time I went to the house—I confess it was not very soon—I encountered his successor, a personage who evidently enjoyed the good fortune of never having quitted his natural level.
199: He made me feel as if Brooksmith were dead; but I didn't dare to inquire—I couldn't have borne his "I haven't the least idea, sir."
200: I despatched a note to the address Brooksmith had given me after Mr. Offord's death, but I received no answer.
201: Six months later, however, I was favoured with a visit from an elderly, dreary, dingy person, who introduced herself to me as Mr. Brooksmith's aunt and from whom I learned that he was out of place and out of health and had allowed her to come and say to me that if I could spare half-an-hour to look in at him he would take it as a rare honour.
202: I went the next day—his messenger had given me a new address—and found my friend lodged in a short sordid street in Marylebone, one of those corners of London that wear the last expression of sickly meanness.
211: He was vague himself, and evidently weak, and much embarrassed, and not an allusion was made between us to Mansfield Street.
212: The vision of the salon of which he had been an ornament hovered before me, however, by contrast, sufficiently.
224: A whole year after my visit to him I became aware once, in dining out, that Brooksmith was one of the several servants who hovered behind our chairs.
225: He had not opened the door of the house to me, and I had not recognised him in the cluster of retainers in the hall.
238: As I went away, on this occasion, I looked out for him eagerly among the four or five attendants whose perpendicular persons, fluting the walls of London passages, are supposed to lubricate the process of departure; but he was not on duty.
239: I asked one of the others if he were not in the house, and received the prompt answer: "Just left, sir.
240: Anything I can do for you, sir?"
241: I wanted to say "Please give him my kind regards;" but I abstained; I didn't want to compromise him, and I never came across him again.
242: Often and often, in dining out, I looked for him, sometimes accepting invitations on purpose to multiply the chances of my meeting him.
243: But always in vain; so that as I met many other members of the casual class over and over again, I at last adopted the theory that he always procured a list of expected guests beforehand and kept away from the banquets which he thus learned I was to grace.
244: At last I gave up hope, and one day, at the end of three years, I received another visit from his aunt.
245: She was drearier and dingier, almost squalid, and she was in great tribulation and want.
249: These were details; the great and romantic fact was Brooksmith's final evasion of his fate.
250: He had gone out to wait one evening, as usual, in a white waistcoat she had done up for him with her own hands, being due at a large party up Kensington way.
251: But he had never come home again, and had never arrived at the large party, or at any party that any one could make out.
253: This news was a sharp shock to me, for I had my ideas about his real destination.
255: Somehow and somewhere he had got out of the way altogether, and now I trust that, with characteristic deliberation, he is changing the plates of the immortal gods.
