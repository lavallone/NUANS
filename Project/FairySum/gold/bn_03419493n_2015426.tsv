2: A seriously ill man was waiting for me in a village ten miles distant.
3: A severe snowstorm filled the space between him and me.
7: My servant girl was at that very moment running around the village to see if she could borrow a horse, but it was hopeless—I knew that—and I stood there useless, increasingly covered with snow, becoming all the time more immobile.
8: The girl appeared at the gate, alone.
17: A man huddled down in the stall below showed his open blue-eyed face.
23: “Hey, Brother, hey Sister,” the groom cried out, and two horses, powerful animals with strong flanks, shoved their way one behind the other, legs close to the bodies, lowering their well-formed heads like camels, and getting through the door space, which they completely filled, only through the powerful movements of their rumps.
32: Then he says, “Climb in,” and, in fact, everything is ready.
36: “Of course,” he says; “I’m not going with you.
37: I’m staying with Rosa.”
38: “No,” screams Rosa and runs into the house, with an accurate premonition of the inevitability of her fate.
44: “Giddy up,” he says and claps his hands.
48: Then I am already there, as if the farm yard of my invalid opens up immediately in front of my courtyard gate.
51: The sick man’s parents rush out of the house, his sister behind them.
57: Thin, without fever, not cold, not warm, with empty eyes, without a shirt, the young man under the stuffed quilt heaves himself up, hangs around my throat, and whispers in my ear, “Doctor, let me die.”
78: The mother stands by the bed and entices me over.
79: I follow and, as a horse neighs loudly at the ceiling, lay my head on the young man’s chest, which trembles under my wet beard.
80: That confirms what I know: the young man is healthy.
86: What am I doing here in this endless winter!
96: With the help of my night bell the entire region torments me, but that this time I had to sacrifice Rosa as well, this beautiful girl, who lives in my house all year long and whom I scarcely notice—this sacrifice is too great, and I must somehow in my own head subtly rationalize it away for the moment, in order not to let loose at this family who cannot, even with their best will, give me Rosa back again.
97: But as I am closing up by hand bag and calling for my fur coat, the family is standing together, the father sniffing the glass of rum in his hand, the mother, probably disappointed in me—what more do these people expect?—tearfully biting her lips, and the sister flapping a very bloody hand towel, I am somehow ready, in the circumstances, to concede that the young man is perhaps nonetheless sick.
100: On his right side, in the region of the hip, a wound the size of the palm of one’s hand has opened up.
106: Poor young man, there’s no helping you.
108: You are dying from this flower on your side.
111: “Will you save me?” whispers the young man, sobbing, quite blinded by the life inside his wound.
112: That’s how people are in my region.
113: Always demanding the impossible from the doctor.
147: “Young friend,” I say, “your mistake is that you have no perspective.
148: I’ve already been in all the sick rooms, far and wide, and I tell you your wound is not so bad.
149: Made in a tight corner with two blows from an axe.
150: Many people offer their side and hardly hear the axe in the forest, to say nothing of the fact that it’s coming closer to them.”
151: “Is that really so, or are you deceiving me in my fever?”
152: “It is truly so.
153: Take the word of honour of a medical doctor.”
155: But now it was time to think about my escape.
159: One horse obediently pulled back from the window.
160: I threw the bundle into the carriage.
163: I swung myself up onto the horse.
165: “Giddy up,” I said, but there was no giddying up about it.
169: I’ll never come home at this rate.
175: Naked, abandoned to the frost of this unhappy age, with an earthly carriage and unearthly horses, I drive around by myself, an old man.
179: Once one responds to a false alarm on the night bell, there’s no making it good again—not ever.
