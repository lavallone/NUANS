0: DETECTIVE CRADDOCK stepped nearer the front of the little cigar store on the corner, and almost pressed his nose against the window as he glanced inside.
14: For Thubway Tham was inside, and not purchasing a package of cigarettes or begging for a box of matches.
15: Thubway Tham was behind the counter, waiting on trade.
17: He grinned at Thubway Tham, but Tham’s face expressed only the fact that he was a business man.
49: “Go right ahead, Tham, old boy,” he said.
50: “But don’t forget that I’ll have an eye on you.
59: Tham grinned after Craddock had gone down the street, and then gave his entire attention to the trade.
62: He sold a package of cigarettes to an evillooking youth, and changed a five-dollar bill.
63: Ten minutes later his employer, going through the cash register, found the bill and informed Thubway Tham that it was a counterfeit.
72: Thubway Tham was of a mind that it was a reflection on his cleverness to be stung like that.
101: The evening rush began, and Tham’s, employer returned to aid him with the trade.
104: There entered a man who filled Thubway Tham’s heart with joy—until he remembered that he had turned honest.
113: You want to watch out for crookth.”
132: He announced that he would shake dice with Tham for the cigars.
139: Almost before he realized it, the customer from out of town had won ten dollars.
143: Tham’s boss came back, and the customer hurried away.
150: He went away in a hurry, and he took our dice and left his own.”
156: Thubway Tham’s face paled.
171: It cotht too much to work in thith plathe.
173: I quit!”
174: Without waiting to argue the matter, Thubway Tham hurried down the street, came to Union Square, and darted toward the entrance to the subway.
196: He saw the stranger within the city’s gates, who had beaten him with loaded dice.
197: And he saw the evil-looking youth who had slipped him the counterfeit bill.
198: Thubway Tham knew at a glance that the evil-appearing youth was a crook, that he had spotted the visitor to the city, and was hoping to relieve him of his wealth.
209: After a time the evil-looking youth scientifically removed the wallet from the other’s hip pocket.
210: The next instant Detective Craddock had him by the arm.
222: As Detective Craddock started for the nearest subway entrance with his prisoner and the victim, Thubway Tham followed, shadowing the trio as well as ever detective shadowed a suspect.
228: Thubway Tham stepped up close behind him for an instant—and in that instant his hand dived into Craddock’s pocket and took out the countryman’s wallet.
235: Tham left the train at the next station, walked rapidly down the street, then turned into an alley.
248: Somebody slapped him on the shoulder.
251: Thubway Tham whirled around to face the countryman.
252: “Hello!”
264: You know what I did, young feller?
266: I said as how there was “a hundred dollars in that wallet, and I demanded that the detective pay me back.
268: Finally he give me fifty, and I called it square.
282: Thubway Tham chuckled until the tears started from his eyes.
288: He led the way to the nearest resort that had plenty of bright lights.
289: He ordered drinks and paid for them, and whispered to the countryman about the joke, and they had more drinks and laughed aloud at Detective Craddock.
299: “You look like an honest young feller,” he said.
301: I can’t enjoy myself while I’m worryin’ about my money.
302: You take it—here—and keep it for me.
317: He knew that he could evade the countryman in some resort that had doors opening onto two streets, but he decided to be honest for the time being.
320: He followed the countryman for two hours more.
321: They changed some of the bills, but when midnight came, and the visitor decided that he would return to his hotel and go to bed, there remained something like seventy-five dollars.
323: He drifted into one of the saloons they had patronized earlier in the evening, and the proprietor hailed him.
327: You bought the drinks and changed a ten.
328: And the ten is a bad one—that’s what’s the matter with me.”
337: Had the visitor to the city played him for an easy mark, got him to pass the money so that, if an arrest came, Tham would be the one arrested?
348: Thubway Tham was deadly angry now.
349: He plunged into the subway, got into a crowded car, “lifted a leather,” and got out at Twenty-eighth street.
352: Thubway Tham was collecting for the misfortunes of the day.
