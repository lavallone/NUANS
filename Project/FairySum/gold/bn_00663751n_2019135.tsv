0: Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion.
3: It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts—as far as I comprehend them myself.
4: They are, succinctly, these: My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and about nine months ago, it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission: no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis.
5: It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be arrested by the process.
7: In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the "Bibliotheca Forensica," and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marz) of the Polish versions of "Wallenstein" and "Gargantua."
13: For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis.
17: I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited.
22: "You may as well come now. D—— and F—— are agreed that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very nearly.
23: "Valdemar."
24: I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber.
40: It was the opinion of both physicians that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday).
44: When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the experiment proposed.
45: He still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once.
46: A male and a female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove.
47: I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when the arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance (Mr. Theodore L——l), relieved me from further embarrassment.
50: It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L——l, whether he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.
51: He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, "Yes, I wish to be mesmerized"—adding immediately afterward, "I fear you have deferred it too long."
52: While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found most effectual in subduing him.
53: He was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I exerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o'clock when Doctors D—— and F—— called, according to appointment.
54: I explained to them, in a few words, what I designed, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was already in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation—exchanging, however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.
55: By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.
59: At five minutes before eleven, I perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence.
65: When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar's condition.
66: After a few experiments, they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance.
74: In such experiments with this patient, I had never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my , his arm very readily, although feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine.
76: "M. Valdemar," I said, "are you asleep?"
78: At its third repetition, his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words: "Yes;—asleep now.
79: Do not wake me!—let me die so!"
129: From this period unti the close of last week—an interval of nearly seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends.
132: It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles—to so much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.
139: Dr. F—— then intimated a desire to have me put a question.
140: I did so as follows: "M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now?"
141: There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before); and at length the same hideous voice which I have already described, broke forth:
142: "For God's sake!—quick!—quick!—put me to sleep—or, quick!—waken me!—quick!—I say to you that I am dead!"
144: At first I made an endeavor to recompose the patient; but failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him.
145: In this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful—or at least I soon fancied that my success would be complete—and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.
147: As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of "dead! dead!"
149: Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence.
