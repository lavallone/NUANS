0: A POOR widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red.
1: She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red.
15: One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance.
17: Rose-red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the door.
18: Rose-red screamed aloud
20: But the bear began to speak, and said: ‘Don’t be afraid: I won’t hurt you.
21: I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.’
24: So they both came out of their hiding-places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot their fear.
26: Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably.
34: From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance.
35: When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and not return again the whole summer.’
37: ‘I must go to the wood and prootect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs.
40: A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots.
41: They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn’t distinguish.
42: When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long.
43: The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain, and didn’t seem to know what he was to do.
51: The children did all in their power, but they couldn’t get the beard out; it was wedged in far too firmly.
55: Does nothing better occur to you than that?’ ‘Don’t be so impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I’ll see you get help;’ and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut the end off his beard.
56: As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: ‘Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!’
74: It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons.
75: Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there.
77: Immediately afterwards they heard a sharp, piercing cry.
78: They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off.
79: The tender-hearted children seized a hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey.
80: When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice: ‘Couldn’t you have treated me more carefully?
81: you have torn my thin little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!’
82: Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave.
83: The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town.
84: On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour.
87: He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood.
88: The dwarf jumped up in a great fright, but he hadn’t time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already close to him.
89: Then he cried in terror: ‘Dear Mr. Bear, spare me!
90: I’ll give you all my treasure.
95: There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven’s sake.’
96: But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.
98: Then they recognised his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all dressed in gold.
99: ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free.
101: Snow-white married him, and Rose-red his brother, and they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them.
