0: Sheehan's Pool Room, which adorns one of the lesser alleys in the heart of Chicago's stockyard district, is not a nice place.
4: Sheehan's is the acknowledged centre to Chicago's subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attaches of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity—one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of Sheehan's.
5: He was called "Old Bugs", and was the most disreputable object in a disreputable environment.
7: Whence he had come, no one could tell.
10: One steady patron—a bank defaulter under cover—came to converse with him quite regularly, and from the tone of his discourse ventured the opinion that he had been a writer or professor in his day.
11: But the only tangible clue to Old Bugs' past was a faded photograph which he constantly carried about with him—the photograph of a young woman of noble and beautiful features.
12: This he would sometimes draw from his tattered pocket, carefully unwrap from its covering of tissue paper, and gaze upon for hours with an expression of ineffable sadness and tenderness.
13: It was not the portrait of one whom an underworld denizen would be likely to know, but of a lady of breeding and quality, garbed in the quaint attire of thirty years before.
14: Old Bugs himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing bore every hallmark of antiquity.
17: His features had perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of terrible dissipation.
26: But for one thing Old Bugs would have been an ideal slave to the establishment—and that one thing was his conduct when young men were introduced for their first drink.
30: I do not think that many of Sheehan's regular patrons will ever forget the day that young Alfred Trever came.
32: Trever was the son of prominent parents in Appleton.
33: His father, Karl Trever, was an attorney and citizen of distinction, whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a poetess under her maiden name of Eleanor Wing.
34: Alfred was himself a scholar and poet of distinction, though cursed with a certain childish irresponsibility which made him an ideal prey for Sheehan's runner.
37: He knew deeper vices through books, and he now longed to know them at first hand.
38: Perhaps this tendency toward wildness had been stimulated somewhat by the repression to which he had been subjected at home; for Mrs. Trever had particular reason for training her only child with rigid severity.
50: Eleanor Wing soon celebrated her marriage to Karl Trever, a rising young lawyer, and of her former admirer retained only enough memory to dictate the naming of her only son, and the moral guidance of that handsome and headstrong youth.
51: Now, in spite of all that guidance, Alfred Trever was at Sheehan's and about to take his first drink.
52: "Boss," cried Schultz, as he entered the vile-smelling room with his young victim, "meet my friend Al Trever, bes' li'1' sport up at Lawrence—thas"n Appleton, Wis., y' know.
55: As the names Trever, Lawrence, and Appleton fell on the air, the loafers seemed to sense something unusual.
58: "This is my first experience in a place like this, but I am a student of life, and don't want to miss any experience.
60: "Young feller," responded the proprietor, "ya come tuh th' right place tuh see life.
62: The damn' government can try tuh make folks good of it wants tuh, but it can't stop a feller from hittin"er up when he feels like it.
68: I can't read an Anacreontic without watering at the mouth—and it's something a lot stronger than water that my mouth waters for!"
71: "Let me see, Trever," continued the defaulter, "didn't Schultz say your mother is a literary person, too?"
75: She writes under her maiden name of Eleanor Wing."
76: Here it was that Old Bugs dropped his mop.
82: Old Bugs, springing up from the crouching position in which he had hitherto been, leaped at the youth and dashed from his hands the uplifted glass, almost simultaneously attacking the tray of bottles and glasses with his mop, and scattering the contents upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles and tumblers.
84: Old Bugs straightened up before the astonished Trever, and in a mild and cultivated voice said, "Do not do this thing.
85: I was like you once, and I did it.
86: Now I am like—this."
87: "What do you mean, you damned old fool?" shouted Trever.
90: "This is the last time far you, old bird!"
93: Now get th' hell outa here afore I kick hell outa ya."
97: The room became pandemonium, and men screamed and howled in fright at the sinister being they had aroused.
102: Policemen appeared at the door, attracted by the noise, but for a time they made no move to intervene.
103: Trever, now thoroughly terrified and cured forever of his desire to see life via the vice route, edged closer to the blue-coated newcomers.
104: Could he but escape and catch a train for Appleton, he reflected, he would consider his education in dissipation quite complete.
105: Then suddenly Old Bugs ceased to wield his javelin and stopped still—drawing himself up more erectly than any denizen of the place had ever seen him before.
107: he shouted, and dropped to the whiskey-reeking floor, never to rise again.
108: Subsequent impressions will never leave the mind of young Trever.
109: The picture is blurred, but ineradicable.
110: Policemen ploughed a way through the crowd, questioning everyone closely both about the incident and about the dead figure on the floor.
111: Sheehan especially did they ply with inquiries, yet without eliciting any information of value concerning Old Bugs.
117: Then the picture was passed to Trever, and a change came over the youth.
120: No, he said hastily, as the question was put to him, he did not know the subject of the picture.
121: It was so old, he added, that no one now could be expected to recognise it.
122: But Alfred Trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in Appleton.
123: Over the library mantel in his home hung the exact replica of that picture, and all his life he had known and loved its original.
124: For the gentle and noble features were those of his own mother.
