0: KEOLA was married with Lehua, daughter of Kalamake, the wise man Molokai, and he kept his dwelling with the father of his wife.
11: Kalamake was a man that spared for nothing, whether to eat or to drink, or to wear; and for all he paid in bright new dollars.
13: Yet he neither sold, nor planted, nor took hire—only now and then from his sorceries—and there was no source conceivable for so much silver coin.
29: So they stepped together into the parlor, which was a very fine room, papered and hung with prints, and furnished with a rocking-chair, and a table and a sofa in the European style.
31: Kalamake made Keola close the shutters of the windows, while he himself locked all the doors and set open the lid of the desk.
32: From this he brought forth a pair of necklaces hung with charms and shells, a bundle of dried herbs, and the dried leaves of trees, and a green branch of palm.
41: And suddenly, to the mat on which they were standing came a snatch or twitch, that seemed to be more swift than lightning.
43: Volumes of sun rolled upon his eyes and head, and he found himself transported to a beach of the sea, under a strong sun, with a great surf roaring: he and the warlock standing there on the same mat, speechless, gasping and grasping at one another, and passing their hands before their eyes.
47: "And, in the name of God, where are we?" cried Keola.
48: "That is not the question," replied the sorcerer.
50: Go, while I recover my breath, into the borders of the wood, and bring me the leaves of such and such a herb, and such and such a tree, which you will find to grow there plentifully—three handfuls of each.
77: And with that he began to grow afraid himself, and returned to Kalamake bringing the leaves.
82: "It seemed none saw me," said Keola.
83: "And none did," replied the sorcerer.
85: Yet they hear us; and therefore it is well to speak softly, as I do."
90: As soon as the leaves caught, the sorcerer leaped like a deer out of the circle, and began to race along the beach like a hound that has been bathing.
91: As he ran, he kept stooping to snatch shells; and it seemed to Keola that they glittered as he took them.
92: The leaves blazed with a clear flame that consumed them swiftly; and presently Keola had but a handful left, and the sorcerer was far off, running and stopping.
98: The flame was ready to expire when, with a great leap, he bounded on the mat.
99: The wind of his leaping blew it out, and with that the beach was gone, and the sun and the sea; and they stood once more in the dimness of the shuttered parlor, and were once more shaken and blinded; and on the mat betwixt them lay a pile of shining dollars.
104: Never a word more said Kalamake, nor referred again to that affair.
105: But it ran all the while in Keola's head—if he were lazy before, he would now do nothing.
106: "Why should I work," thought he, "when I have a father-in-law who makes dollars of seashells?"
128: And he went straight to where his father-in-law was sitting in the parlor.
129: "Kalamake," said he, "I want a concertina."
136: A concertina?
137: You shall have the best in Honolulu.
138: And to-night, as soon as it is dark, you and I will go and find the money."
153: As soon as it was dark father and son-in-law launched Pili's boat and set the sail.
170: "And now," said the wizard, "what do you think about that concertina?
176: The boat ran still to the north, but he reached out his hand, and took the gunwale by the finger and thumb, and broke the side like a biscuit, and Keola was spilled into the sea.
180: Since first the islands were fished out of the sea, there was never a man so terrified as this Keola.
185: He cried out aloud and a voice answered; and in a twinkling the bows of a ship hung above him on a wave like a thing balanced, and swooped down.
186: He caught with his two hands in the chains of her, and the next moment was buried in the rushing seas, and the next hauled on board by seamen.
195: In some ways the ship was a good place.
198: The trouble was the mate, who was the most difficult man to please Keola had ever met with, and beat and cursed him daily, both for what he did and what he did not.
201: Keola saw it would never do; and he made up his mind to run away.
203: It was a fine starry night, the sea was smooth as well as the sky fair; it blew a steady trade; and there was the island on their weather bow, a ribbon of palm trees lying flat along the sea.
216: With that he kept edging the schooner nearer in.
218: So Keola edged her up little by little, and kept all drawing.
220: With that, the mate sat up suddenly upon the house.
223: And he made one bound for Keola, and Keola made another clean over the rail and plump into the starry sea.
239: "It cannot be," he thought, "and yet it is very like.
242: So that after all we may have sailed in a circle, and I may be quite near to Molokai, and this may be the very beach where my father-in-law gathers his dollars."
244: It was perhaps a month later, when the people of the place arrived—the fill of six great boats.
245: They were a fine race of men, and spoke a tongue that sounded very different from the tongue of Hawaii, but so many of the words were the same that it was not difficult to understand.
272: So he told the high chief he had once been in an isle that was pestered the same way, and the folk had found a means to cure that trouble.
273: "There was a tree growing in the bush there," says he, "and it seems these devils came to get the leaves of it.
274: So the people of the isle cut down the tree wherever it was found, and the devils came no more."
275: They asked what kind of a tree this was, and he showed them the tree of which Kalamake burned the leaves.
331: Early the next day, before the sun was yet up, a bustle woke him.
333: Only, on the beach in front of him, the bodiless voices called and shouted one upon another, and it seemed they all passed and swept beside him up the coast of the island.
336: "It is not me they are angry at," thought Keola, "for they pass me close."
338: So he turned one point of the island, and this brought him in view of a second; and there he remembered the wizard trees to have been growing by the score together in a wood.
341: And at this a thought came at last into his mind that the high chief had consented; that the men of the tribe had set-to cutting down these trees; that word had gone about the isle from sorcerer to sorcerer, and these were all now assembling to defend their trees.
356: "Keola!" said a voice close by upon the empty sand.
357: "Lehua! is that you!"
359: "I saw you pass before," the voice answered; "but you would not hear me.
367: So Keola ran for his life, and fetched the wizard fuel; and Lehua guided him back, and set his feet upon the mat, and made the fire.
369: And all the time of the burning, Keola stood there and listened, and shook, and watched how the unseen hands of Lehua poured the leaves.
371: The last leaf was eaten, the flame fell, and the shock followed, and there were Keola and Lehua in the room at home.
372: Now, when Keola could see his wife at last he was mighty pleased, and he was mighty pleased to be home again in Molokai and sit down beside a bowl of poi—for they make no poi on board ships, and there was none in the Isle of Voices—and he was out of the body with pleasure to be clean escaped out of the hands of the eaters of men.
374: There was Kalamake left upon the isle.
387: But whether he was slain in the battle by the trees, or whether he is still kicking his heels upon the Isle of Voices, who shall say?
