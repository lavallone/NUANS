0: WELL, there was once a very rich gentleman, and he had three daughters, and he thought he'd see how fond they were of him.
1: So he says to the first, "How much do you love me, my dear?"
2: "Why," says she, "as I love my life."
4: So he says to the second, "How much do you love me.
5: my dear?"
6: "Why," says she, "better nor all the world."
8: So he says to the third, "How much do you love me, my dear?"
9: "Why, I love you as fresh meat loves salt," says she.
11: "You don't love me at all," says he, "and in my house you stay no more."
12: So he drove her out there and then, and shut the door in her face.
13: Well, she went away on and on till she came to a fen, and there she gathered a lot of rushes and made them into a kind of a sort of a cloak with a hood, to cover her from head to foot, and to hide her fine clothes.
14: And then she went on and on till she came to a great house.
19: So she stayed there and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans and did all the dirty work.
20: And because she gave no name they called her "Cap o' Rushes."
21: Well, one day there was to be a great dance a little way off, and the servants were allowed to go and look on at the grand people.
22: Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, so she stayed at home.
23: But when they were gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes, and cleaned herself, and went to the dance.
25: Well, who should be there but her master's son, and what should he do but fall in love with her the minute he set eyes on her.
28: Cap o' Rushes slipt off, and away she went home.
36: "Well, there's to be another dance this evening, and perhaps she'll be there."
37: But, come the evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go with them.
38: Howsoever, when they were gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes and cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance.
39: The master's son had been reckoning on seeing her, and he danced with no one else, and never took his eyes off her.
40: But, before the dance was over, she slipt off, and home she went, and when the maids came back she pretended to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on.
44: "Well," says they, "there's a dance again this evening, and you must go with us, for she's sure to be there."
45: Well, come this evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, and do what they would she stayed at home.
46: But when they were gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes and cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance.
49: When she wouldn't tell him her name, nor where she came from, he gave her a ring and told her if he didn't see her again he should die.
50: Well, before the dance was over, off she slipped, and home she went, and when the maids came home she was pretending to be asleep with her cap 'o rushes on.
51: Well, next day they says to her, "There, Cap o' Rushes, you didn't come last night, and now you won't see the lady, for there's no more dances."
54: And he got worse and worse for the love of her till he had to keep his bed.
55: "Make some gruel for the young master," they said to the cook.
61: Well, the cook wouldn't at first, but at last she said yes, and Cap o' Rushes made the gruel.
62: And when she had made it, she slipped the ring into it on the sly before the cook took it upstairs.
64: "Send for the cook," says he.
66: "Who made this gruel here?" says he.
71: "Well, then, 't was Cap o' Rushes," says she.
73: So Cap o' Rushes came.
74: "Did you make my gruel?" says he.
75: "Yes, I did," says she.
80: And she offed with her cap o' rushes, and there she was in her beautiful clothes.
81: Well, the master's son he got well very soon, and they were to be married in a little time.
85: But before the wedding, she went to the cook, and says she: "I want you to dress every dish without a mite o' salt."
91: When they began to eat the meat, it was so tasteless they couldn't eat it.
92: But Cap o' Rushes's father tried first one dish and then another, and then he burst out crying.
94: "Oh!" says he, "I had a daughter.
95: And I asked her how much she loved me.
98: And now I see she loved me best of all.
99: And she may be dead for ought I know."
100: "No, father, here she is!" said Cap o' Rushes.
102: And so they were all happy ever after.
