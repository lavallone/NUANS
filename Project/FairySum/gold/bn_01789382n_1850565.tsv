0: Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill mountains.
4: At the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager may have descried the light smoke curling up from a village, whose shingle roofs gleam among the trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape.
7: In that same village, and in one of these very houses (which, to tell the precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain, a simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle.
29: If left to himself, he would have whistled life away, in perfect contentment; but his wife kept continually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his carelessness, and the ruin he was bringing on his family.
47: Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair, and his only alternative to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his wife, was to take gun in hand, and stroll away into the woods.
48: Here he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share the contents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a fellow-sufferer in persecution.
58: As he was about to descend he heard a voice from a distance hallooing, “Rip Van Winkle!
63: Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over him; he looked anxiously in the same direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks, and bending under the weight of something he carried on his back.
67: His dress was of the antique Dutch fashion--a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist--several pair of breeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of buttons down the sides, and bunches at the knees.
68: He bore on his shoulders a stout keg, that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach and assist him with the load.
70: As they ascended, Rip every now and then heard long rolling peals, like distant thunder, that seemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft between lofty rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted.
72: Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a small amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the brinks of which, impending trees shot their branches, so that you only caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud.
75: On a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking personages playing at nine-pins.
76: They were dressed in a quaint outlandish fashion: some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in their belts, and most of them had enormous breeches, of similar style with that of the guide’s.
78: They all had beards, of various shapes and colors.
85: His companion now emptied the contents of the keg into large flagons, and made signs to him to wait upon the company.
88: He even ventured, when no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had much of the flavor of excellent Hollands.
89: He was naturally a thirsty soul, and was soon tempted to repeat the draught.
90: One taste provoked another, and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often, that at length his senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head gradually declined, and he fell into a deep sleep.
91: On waking, he found himself on the green knoll from whence he had first seen the old man of the glen.
99: He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean well-oiled fowling-piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel encrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten.
101: Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a squirrel or partridge.
116: As he approached the village, he met a number of people, but none whom he knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself acquainted with every one in the country round.
119: The constant recurrence of this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same, when, to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!
146: In place of these, a lean bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens--election--members of Congress--liberty--Bunker’s hill--heroes of seventy-six--and other words, that were a perfect Babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.
149: The orator bustled up to him, and drawing him partly aside, inquired, “on which side he voted?”
152: Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing, self-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way through the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm a-kimbo, the other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating, as it were, into his very soul, demanded in an austere tone, “what brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?”
153: “Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, “I am a poor, quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the King, God bless him!”
154: Here a general shout burst from the bystanders--“a tory!
155: a tory!
156: a spy!
157: a refugee! hustle him!
158: away with him!”
181: At this critical moment a fresh comely woman passed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man.
185: “What is your name, my good woman?” asked he.
186: “Judith Gardenier.”
187: “And your father’s name?”
188: “Ah, poor man, his name was Rip Van Winkle; it’s twenty years since he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of since--his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or was carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell.
196: All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for a moment, exclaimed, “Sure enough!
197: it is Rip Van Winkle--it is himself.
198: Welcome home again, old neighbor--Why, where have you been these twenty long years?”
199: Rip’s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but as one night.
