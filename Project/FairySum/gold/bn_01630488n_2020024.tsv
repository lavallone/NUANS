14: Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934-5, taking the upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College Street—on the crest of the great eastward hill near the Brown University campus and behind the marble John Hay Library.
30: Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most fascinated Blake.
45: More and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds.
49: Plodding through the endless downtown streets and the bleak, decayed squares beyond, he came finally upon the ascending avenue of century-worn steps, sagging Doric porches, and blear-paned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the long-known, unreachable world beyond the mists.
55: He crossed two or three broad avenues, and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower.
56: Again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone, and this time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned.
57: The dark man's face had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curious sign with his right hand.
58: Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left, above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys.
59: Blake knew at once what it was, and plunged toward it through the squalid, unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue.
64: The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude.
72: There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at the northerly end and approached him with questions about the church.
74: When Blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the Italian priest warned everybody against it, vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark.
75: He himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father, who recalled certain sounds and rumours from his boyhood.
76: There had been a bad sect there in the old days—an outlaw sect that called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night.
84: After the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile.
102: A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture.
114: Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion.
122: In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and ceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books.
123: Here for the first time he received a positive shock of objective horror, for the titles of those books told him much.
124: They were the black, forbidden things which most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard of only in furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secret and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man's youth, and the dim, fabulous days before man was.
127: Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied.
128: This place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe.
135: Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple—objects so long familiar to him at a distance.
139: Here he was doomed to disappointment; for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and clearly devoted to vastly different purposes.
142: In the centre of the dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs.
143: On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form; its hinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding what looked beneath the decade-deep dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through.
146: As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on the strange open box of yellowish metal.
147: Approaching, he tried to clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting entities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this planet.
148: The four-inch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter.
153: When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple.
155: Ploughing toward it, and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs as he went, he began to discern something grim about it.
157: It was a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time.
160: Blake examined the latter with care, finding within it several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893, some cards with the name "Edwin M. Lillibridge", and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda.
162: Its disjointed text included such phrases as the following:
166: 1846—3 disappearances—first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.
169: Fr. O'Malley tells of devil-worship with box found in great Egyptian ruins—says they call up something that can't exist in light. Flees a little light, and banished by strong light. Then has to be summoned again. Probably got this from deathbed confession of Francis X. Feeney, who had joined Starry Wisdom in '49. These people say the Shining Trapezohedron shows them heaven & other worlds, & that the Haunter of the Dark tells them secrets in some way.
191: Before he realized it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind.
192: He saw processions of robed, hooded figures whose outlines were not human, and looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching monoliths.
194: And beyond all else he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semisolid forms were known only by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed to superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana of the worlds we know.
195: Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing, indeterminate panic fear.
196: Blake choked and turned away from the stone, conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness.
197: He felt entangled with something—something which was not in the stone, but which had looked through it at him—something which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not physical sight.
200: It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone.
201: He had tried to look away from it, but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes back.
202: Was there a subtle phosphorescence of radio-activity about the thing?
203: What was it that the dead man's notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron?
207: Blake seized the cover of the long-open box and snapped it down.
209: At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the steeple's eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door.
211: And yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted basement, out amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square, and down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of Federal Hill towards the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks of the college district.
238: In writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire.
242: In the night a thunderstorm had put the city's lighting-system out of commission for a full hour, and in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with fright.
243: Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps' absence and gone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, altogether dreadful way.
244: Towards the last it had bumped up to the tower, where there were sounds of the shattering of glass.
245: It could go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it fleeing.
248: During the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas—a guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness.
297: The great storm broke just before midnight on 8 August.
304: Then the lights went out all over the city.
307: On Federal Hill there were watchers as anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oil lanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern Italy.
309: A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew threateningly dark.
310: Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church, and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could.
325: At the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden east-blowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas from the crowd.
339: Students in the Psi Delta house, whose upper rear windows looked into Blake's study, noticed the blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the ninth, and wondered what was wrong with the expression.
340: When they saw the same face in the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched for the lights to come up in his apartment.
341: Later they rang the bell of the darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the door.
342: The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive fright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened dismay.
343: Shortly afterwards the coroner's physician made an examination, and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous tension induced by electrical discharge, as the cause of death.
350: Excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on Blake's part, aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he had uncovered, form the dominant interpretation given those final frenzied jottings.
351: These are the entries—or all that can be made of them:
362: I see it—coming here—hell-wind—titan blur—black wing—Yog Sothoth save me—the three-lobed burning eye . . .
