4: One passion only had power to draw me from my studies; and yet, what was that passion but a study of another kind?
5: I used to watch the manners and customs of the Faubourg, its inhabitants, and their characteristics.
12: As I listened, I could make their lives mine, I felt their rags on my back, I walked with their gaping shoes on my feet; their cravings, their needs, had all passed into my soul, or my soul had passed into theirs.
27: One day my charwoman, a working man's wife, came to beg me to honor her sister's wedding with my presence.
46: The band consisted of a fiddle, a clarionet, and a flageolet from the Blind Asylum.
51: I thought of nothing else; the wedding party and the music ceased to exist, my curiosity was roused to the highest pitch, for my soul passed into the body of the clarionet player.
70: "What part of the world do you come from, you that are playing the clarionet?"
71: "From Venice," he said, with a trace of Italian accent.
72: "Have you always been blind, or did it come on afterwards--"  "Afterwards," he answered quickly.
91: "What is your name?"
92: "Here, in Paris, I am Pere Canet," he said.
94: But in Italy I am Marco Facino Cane, Prince of Varese."
95: "What, are you descended from the great _condottiere_ Facino Cane, whose lands won by the sword were taken by the Dukes of Milan?"
96: "_E vero_," returned he.
101: How did you lose your fortune?"
102: "In evil days."
128: I was one-and-twenty years old, like you at this moment.
134: In 1760 I fell in love with a lady of the Vendramin family; she was eighteen years old, and married to a Sagredo, one of the richest senators, a man of thirty, madly in love with his wife.
135: My mistress and I were guiltless as cherubs when the _sposo_ caught us together talking of love.
136: He was armed, I was not, but he missed me; I sprang upon him and killed him with my two hands, wringing his neck as if he had been a chicken.
137: I wanted Bianca to fly with me; but she would not.
141: "I went to Milan, no one molested me, my affair in nowise interested the State.--One small observation before I go further," he continued, after a pause, "whether it is true or no that the mother's fancies at the time of conception or in the months before birth can influence her child, this much is certain, my mother during her pregnancy had a passion for gold, and I am the victim of a monomania, of a craving for gold which must be gratified.
150: Then the longing to see Bianca once more possessed me like a frenzy.
151: I stole back to Venice and found her again.
152: For six months I was happy; she hid me in her house and fed me.
154: But the Provveditore courted her, and guessed that he had a rival; we in Italy can feel that.
155: He played the spy upon us, and surprised us together in bed, base wretch.
160: "The Provveditore called his servants, the palace was surrounded and entered; I fought for my life that I might die beneath Bianca's eyes; Bianca helped me to kill the Provveditore.
161: Once before she had refused flight with me; but after six months of happiness she wished only to die with me, and received several thrusts.
162: I was entangled in a great cloak that they flung over me, carried down to a gondola, and hurried to the Pozzi dungeons.
165: A curious chance, or rather the instinct of self-preservation, led me to hide the fragment of the blade in a corner of my cell, as if it might still be of use.
176: Groping about with my fingers, I spelled out an Arabic inscription on the wall.
177: The author of the work informed those to come after him that he had loosed two stones in the lowest course of masonry and hollowed out eleven feet beyond underground.
184: A whole month went by before I obtained any result; but whenever I felt my strength failing as I worked, I heard the chink of gold, I saw gold spread before me, I was dazzled by diamonds.--Ah!
191: The Doge himself and one of the Ten stood below; I could hear their voices and sufficient of their talk to know that this was the Secret Treasury of the Republic, full of the gifts of Doges and reserves of booty called the Tithe of Venice from the spoils of military expeditions.
193: "When the jailer came I proposed that he should help me to escape and fly with me, and that we should take with us as much as we could carry.
199: In a single night the hole was enlarged, and we dropped down into the Secret Treasury of Venice.
213: "Covetous though we were, we could not possibly take more than two thousand livres weight of gold, which meant six journeys across the prison to the gondola.
221: We were so completely unnerved by all that had happened, that we were stupid, we said not a word to each other, we waited till it should be safe to enjoy ourselves at our ease.
225: For five years I hid myself in Madrid, then in 1770 I came to Paris with a Spanish name, and led as brilliant a life as may be.
226: Then in the midst of my pleasures, as I enjoyed a fortune of six millions, I was smitten with blindness.
229: "At this time I had fallen in love with a woman to whom I thought to link my fate.
232: Acting on her advice, I went to London to consult a famous oculist, and after a stay of several months in London she deserted me in Hyde Park.
233: She had stripped me of all that I had, and left me without resource.
239: "If only I had taken counsel with my jailer, Benedetto Carpi, before I lost him, I might have known the exact position of my cell, I might have found my way back to the Treasury and returned to Venice when Napoleon crushed the Republic--  "Still, blind as I am, let us go back to Venice!
261: "We will go to Venice!"
268: "Shall we start to-morrow?" he asked.
269: "As soon as we can get some money."
273: Facino Cane died before the winter was out after a two months' illness.
