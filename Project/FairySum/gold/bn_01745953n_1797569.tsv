0: A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below.
1: The man’s hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord.
2: A rope closely encircled his neck.
3: It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees.
4: Some loose boards laid upon the ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners—two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff.
5: At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank, armed.
6: He was a captain.
7: A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as “support,” that is to say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest—a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body.
12: Midway up the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators—a single company of infantry in line, at “parade rest,” the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock.
13: A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right.
20: The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age.
21: He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter.
34: He looked a moment at his “unsteadfast footing,” then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet.
35: A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current.
38: He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children.
39: The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift—all had distracted him.
40: And now he became conscious of a new disturbance.
41: Striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith’s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.
43: Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell.
48: What he heard was the ticking of his watch.
49: He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.
50: “If I could free my hands,” he thought, “I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream.
51: By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home.
52: My home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond the invader’s farthest advance.”
53: As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man’s brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant.
54: The sergeant stepped aside.
61: One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water.
62: Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands.
63: While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.
64: “The Yanks are repairing the railroads,” said the man, “and are getting ready for another advance.
65: They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.
66: The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.
67: I saw the order.”
68: “How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?”
69: Farquhar asked.
70: “About thirty miles.”  “Is there no force on this side of the creek?”
71: “Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.”
72: “Suppose a man—a civilian and student of hanging—should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,” said Farquhar, smiling, “what could he accomplish?”
73: The soldier reflected.
74: “I was there a month ago,” he replied.
75: “I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge.
76: It is now dry and would burn like tinder.”
77: The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank.
78: He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.
79: An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come.
80: He was a Federal scout.
81: As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead.
82: From this state he was awakened—ages later, it seemed to him—by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation.
87: These sensations were unaccompanied by thought.
89: He was conscious of motion.
91: Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.
92: The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream.
93: There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs.
95: He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible!
96: He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer.
97: Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface—knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable.
100: He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands.
105: The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.
106: He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck.
107: They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake.
113: They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface.
114: He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!
115: He was now in full possession of his physical senses.
116: They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert.
117: Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived.
123: He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.
125: They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him.
128: Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray.
129: He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle.
134: The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears.
135: Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning’s work.
136: How coldly and pitilessly—with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquility in the men—with what accurately measured interval fell those cruel words:  “Company!… Attention!…
137: Shoulder arms!…
138: Ready!…
139: Aim!… Fire!”
140: Farquhar dived—dived as deeply as he could.
141: The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward.
144: As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream—nearer to safety.
148: His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning:  “The officer,” he reasoned, “will not make that martinet’s
149: error a second time.
150: It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot.
151: He has probably already given the command to fire at will.
152: God help me, I cannot dodge them all!”
154: A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him!
155: The cannon had taken an hand in the game.
157: “They will not do that again,” he thought; “the next time they will use a charge of grape.
158: I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me—the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile.
159: That is a good gun.”
160: Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round—spinning like a top.
164: In few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream—the southern bank—and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies.
165: The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight.
170: He had not wish to perfect his escape—he was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.
173: He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.
174: All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun.
175: The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman’s road.
178: By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished.
179: The thought of his wife and children urged him on.
180: At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction.
184: The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective.
185: Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations.
186: He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance.
187: The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which—once, twice, and again—he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.
193: Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene—perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium.
194: He stands at the gate of his own home.
195: All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine.
197: As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him.
200: He springs forwards with extended arms.
201: As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon—then all is darkness and silence!
202: Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.
