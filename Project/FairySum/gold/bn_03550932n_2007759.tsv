3: There lived, it is said, once upon a time a King of Rough-Rock, who had a wife the very mother of beauty; but in the full career of her years, she fell from the horse of health and broke her life.
5: Goods used to be sold thus in this country, by what was called 'inch of candle.', she called her husband and said to him, "I know you have always loved me tenderly; show me therefore at the close of my days the completion of your love, by promising me never to marry again, unless you find a woman as beautiful as I have been; otherwise I leave you my curse, and shall bear you hatred even in the other world."
16: every one appears a witch in comparison with her; where then shall I find another with a bit of stick, or seek another with the bellAs children hunt for anything lost in the sand with a little stick (spruoccolo), and the town-crier goes about with his bell., if Nature made Nardella (may she be in glory!) So saying he forthwith issued a proclamation and command by Master Chiommiento, that all the handsome women in the world should come to the of beauty, for he would take the most beautiful to wife and endow her with a kingdom.
25: When the town was thus filled with women, the king had them all drawn up in a line; and he walked up and down, from top to bottom, like a baboon that is never still; and as he examined and measured each from head to foot, one appeared to him wry-browed, another long-nosed, another broad-mouthed, another thick-lipped, another tall as a maypole, another short and dumpy, another too stout, another too slender; the Spaniard did not please him on account of her dark colour, the Neapolitan was not to his fancy on account of her waddling gait, the German appeared cold and icy, the Frenchwoman frivolous and giddy, the Venetian with her light hair looked like a distaff of flax.
26: At the end of the end, one for this cause and another for that, he sent them all away, with one hand before and the other behind; and seeing that so many fair faces were all show and no wool, he turned his thoughts to his own daughter, saying, "Why do I go seeking Maria at Ravenna, when my daughter Preziosa is formed in the same mould of beauty as her mother?
27: I have this fair face here in my house, and yet go looking for it at the fag-end of the world."
28: When Preziosa heard this, she retired to her chamber, and bewailing her ill fortune, she did not leave a hair upon her head; and whilst she was lamenting thus, an old woman came to her, who was her confidant.
29: As soon as she saw Preziosa, who seemed to belong more to the other world than to this, and heard the cause of her grief, the old woman said to her, "Cheer up, my daughter; do not despair; there is a remedy for every evil save death.
30: Now listen: if your father speaks to you thus once again, put this bit of wood into your mouth, and instantly you will be changed into a she-bear; then off with you!
33: As soon as the Sun began to change his quarters, the king ordered the musicians to come; and inviting all his lords and vassals he held a great feast.
35: Then the king asked his courtiers whether he could not marry Preziosa, as she was the picture of his dead wife.
36: But the instant Preziosa heard this, she slipped the bit of wood into her mouth, and took the figure of a terrible she-bear; at the sight of which all present were frightened out of their wits, and ran off as fast as they could scamper.
37: Meanwhile Preziosa went out, and took her way to a wood, where the Shades were holding a consultation how they might do some mischief to the Sun at the close of day.
38: And there she staid, in the pleasant companionship of the other animals, until the son of the king of Running-Water came to hunt in that part of the country, who at the sight of the bear had like to have died on the spot.
39: But when he saw the beast come gently up to him, wagging her tail like a little dog and rubbing her sides against him, he took courage, and patted her, and said, "Good bear, good bear!
42: Then he led her home, and ordered that she should be taken good care of; and he had her put into a garden close to the royal palace, that he might see her from the window whenever he wished.
43: One day, when all the people of the house were gone out, and the prince was left alone, he went to the window to look out at the bear; and there he beheld Preziosa, who had taken the piece of wood out of her mouth, combing her golden tresses.
44: At the sight of this beauty, which was beyond the beyonds, he had like to have lost his senses with amazement, and tumbling down the stairs he ran out into the garden.
45: But Preziosa, who was on the watch and observed him, popped the piece of wood into her mouth, and was instantly changed into a bear again.
46: When the prince came down and looked about in vain for Preziosa, whom he had seen from the window above, he was so amazed at the trick that a deep melancholy came over him, and in four days he fell sick, crying continually, "My bear, my bear!"
47: His mother, hearing him wailing thus, imagined that the bear had done him some hurt, and gave orders that she should be killed.
48: But the servants, enamoured of the tameness of the bear, who made herself beloved by the very stones in the road, took pity on her, and, instead of killing her, they led her to the wood, and told the queen that they had put an end to her. Then he took her home again, and putting her into a chamber said to her, "O lovely morsel for a king who art shut up in this skin!
63: Then his mother, who had no other joy in the world, sat down by his bedside, and said to him, "My son, whence comes all this grief? When the prince heard these words, he said, "Nothing can console me but the sight of the bear; therefore, if you wish to see me well again, let her be brought into this chamber: I will have no one else to attend me, and make my bed, and cook for me, but she herself; and you may be sure that this pleasure will make me well in a trice."
72: Thereupon his mother, although she thought it ridiculous enough for the bear to act as cook and chambermaid, and feared that her son was not in his right mind, yet, in order to gratify him, had the bear fetched.
78: But when the prince saw these pretty offices, they only added fuel to the fire; and if before he wasted by ounces, he now melted away by pounds; and he said to the queen, "My lady mother, if I do not give this bear a kiss, the breath will leave my body."
79: Whereupon the queen, seeing him fainting away, said, "Kiss him, kiss him, my beautiful beast!
84: Meanwhile (I know not how it was) the piece of wood slipped out of Preziosa's mouth, and she remained in the arms of the prince the most beautiful creature in the world; and pressing her to his heart he said, "I have caught you, my little rogue!
87: Then the queen inquired who the beautiful maiden was, and what had brought her to this savage life; and Preziosa related the whole story of her misfortunes, at which the queen, praising her as a good and virtuous girl, told her son that she was content that Preziosa should be his wife.
88: Then the prince, who desired nothing else in life, forthwith pledged her his faith; and the mother giving them her blessing, this happy marriage was celebrated with great feasting and illuminations, and Preziosa experienced the truth of the saying, that
89: "One who acts well may always expect good."
