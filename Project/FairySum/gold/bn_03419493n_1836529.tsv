2: A seriously ill man was waiting for me in a village ten miles distant.
6: My own horse had died the previous night, as a result of over exertion in this icy winter.
7: My servant girl was at that very moment running around the village to see if she could borrow a horse, but it was hopeless—I knew that—and I stood there useless, increasingly covered with snow, becoming all the time more immobile.
8: The girl appeared at the gate, alone.
11: I walked once again across the courtyard.
13: Distracted and tormented, I kicked my foot against the cracked door of the pig sty which had not been used for years.
17: A man huddled down in the stall below showed his open blue-eyed face.
23: “Hey, Brother, hey Sister,” the groom cried out, and two horses, powerful animals with strong flanks, shoved their way one behind the other, legs close to the bodies, lowering their well-formed heads like camels, and getting through the door space, which they completely filled, only through the powerful movements of their rumps.
25: “Help him,” I said, and the girl obediently hurried to hand the wagon harness to the groom.
26: But as soon as she was beside him, the groom puts his arms around her and pushes his face against hers.
28: On the girl’s cheek were red marks from two rows of teeth.
29: “You brute,” I cry out in fury, “do you want the whip?”.
30: But I immediately remember that he is a stranger, that I don’t know where he comes from, and that he’s helping me out of his own free will, when everyone else is refusing to.
33: I notice that I have never before traveled with such a beautiful team of horses, and I climb in happily.
44: “Giddy up,” he says and claps his hands.
45: The carriage is torn away, like a piece of wood in a current.
46: I still hear how the door of my house is breaking down and splitting apart under the groom’s onslaught, and then my eyes and ears are filled with a roaring sound which overwhelms all my senses at once.
48: Then I am already there, as if the farm yard of my invalid opens up immediately in front of my courtyard gate.
51: The sick man’s parents rush out of the house, his sister behind them.
53: I get nothing from their confused talking.
56: I want to push open the window, but first I’ll look at the sick man.
79: I follow and, as a horse neighs loudly at the ceiling, lay my head on the young man’s chest, which trembles under my wet beard.
80: That confirms what I know: the young man is healthy.
94: Now, at this point my visit might have come to an end—they have once more called for my help unnecessarily.
97: But as I am closing up by hand bag and calling for my fur coat, the family is standing together, the father sniffing the glass of rum in his hand, the mother, probably disappointed in me—what more do these people expect?—tearfully biting her lips, and the sister flapping a very bloody hand towel, I am somehow ready, in the circumstances, to concede that the young man is perhaps nonetheless sick.
100: On his right side, in the region of the hip, a wound the size of the palm of one’s hand has opened up.
105: Worms, as thick and long as my little finger, themselves rose coloured and also spattered with blood, are wriggling their white bodies with many limbs from their stronghold in the inner of the wound towards the light.
122: A choir of school children with the teacher at the head stands in front of the house and sings an extremely simple melody with the words
123: --Take his clothes off, then he’ll heal, and if he doesn’t cure, then kill him.
124: It’s only a doctor; it’s only a doctor.--
125: Then I am stripped of my clothes and, with my fingers in my beard and my head tilted to one side, I look at the people quietly.
126: I am completely calm and clear about everything and stay that way, too, although it is not helping me at all, for they are now taking me by the head and feet and dragging me into bed.
127: They lay me against the wall on the side of wound.
134: “Do you know,” I hear someone saying in my ear, “my confidence in you is very small.
147: “Young friend,” I say, “your mistake is that you have no perspective.
148: I’ve already been in all the sick rooms, far and wide, and I tell you your wound is not so bad.
154: He took my word and grew still.
155: But now it was time to think about my escape.
158: I didn’t want to delay by getting dressed; if the horses rushed as they had on the journey out, I should, in fact, be springing out of that bed into my own, as it were.
159: One horse obediently pulled back from the window.
165: “Giddy up,” I said, but there was no giddying up about it.
166: We dragged through the snowy desert like old men; for a long time the fresh but inaccurate singing of the children resounded behind us:
177: Betrayed!
179: Once one responds to a false alarm on the night bell, there’s no making it good again—not ever.
