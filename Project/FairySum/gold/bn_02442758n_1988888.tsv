0: In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper, and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies, and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur’s Round Table.
12: Another giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever he should have him in his power.
13: This giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood; and some time after the death of Cormoran Jack was passing through a wood, and being weary sat down and went to sleep.
14: The giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, where he locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered with the bodies, skulls, and bones of men and women.
16: Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage, and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, and tied it to the window-bars; he then pulled till he had choked them.
17: When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart.
19: He make a strict search through all the rooms, and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads, and almost starved to death.
25: Jack knocked at the door, when there came forth a Welsh giant.
26: Jack said he was a traveller who had lost his way, on which the giant made him welcome, and let him into a room where there there was a good bed to sleep in.
48: ‘Ods splutter hur nails!’ cried the Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be outdone by such a little fellow as Jack, ‘hur can do that hurself;’ so he snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in a moment dropped down dead.
51: Scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady.
52: Jack alighted from his horse, and tying him to an oak tree, put on his invisible coat, under which he carried his sword of sharpness.
54: Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck, plunged his sword into the giant’s body, when the monster gave a groan and expired.
55: The knight and his lady thanked Jack for their deliverance, and invited him to their house, to receive a proper reward for his services.
57: So taking the knight’s directions, he mounted his horse, and soon after came in sight of another giant, who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brother’s return.
62: Jack then proceeded on his journey, and travelled over hills and dales, till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a lonely house, when an old man let him in.
63: When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him: ‘My son, on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the giant Galligantus and a vile magician.
64: I lament the fate of a duke’s daughter, whom they seized as she was walking in her father’s garden, and brought hither transformed into a deer.’
72: Jack, with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the magician was then carried away by a whirlwind; and every knight and beautiful lady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes.
75: Jack then went up to the King, and gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles. 76: Jack’s fame had now spread through the whole country, and at the King’s desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of all his kingdom.
77: After this the King gave him a large estate, on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.
